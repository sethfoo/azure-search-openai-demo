## Technical Analysis # EhlersAutocorrelation ## Description The Ehlers Autocorrelation study is a technical indicator used in the calculation of John F. Ehlerss Autocorrelation Periodogram .
"Its main purpose is to eliminate noise from the price data, reduce effects of the spectral dilation phenomenon, and reveal dominant cycle periods."
"The spectral dilation has been discussed in several studies by John F. Ehlers; for more information on this, refer to sources in the ""Further Reading"" section."
"As the first step, Autocorrelation uses Mr. Ehlerss previous installment, Ehlers Roofing Filter , in order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and neutralize the spectral dilation."
"This filter is based on aerospace analog filters and when applied to market data, it attempts to only pass spectral components whose periods are between 10 and 48 bars."
"Autocorrelation is then applied to the filtered data: as its name implies, this function correlates the data with itself a certain period back."
"As with other correlation techniques, the value of +1 would signify the perfect correlation and -1, the perfect anti-correlation."
Using values of Autocorrelation in Thermo Mode may help you reveal the cycle periods within which the data is best correlated (or anti-correlated) with itself.
Those periods are displayed in the extreme colors (red and green) while areas of intermediate colors mark periods of less useful cycles.
## Input Parameters ` lag ` | Defines the lookback period for prior data to calculate the correlation with.
---|--- ` averaging length ` | Defines the correlation period.
"If set to 0, the ` lag ` parameter will be used instead."
## Plots ` Autocorrelation ` | The Ehlers Autocorrelation plot.

"EfficiencyRatio EhlersAutocorrelationPeriodogram ## Technical Analysis # EhlersSuperSmootherFilter ## Description The Ehlers' Super Smoother Filter is a smoothing technique developed by John F. Ehlers, based on aerospace analog filters."
"This filter aims at reducing noise in price data, which appears to be stronger as the high-to-low price swings increase especially when chart is plotted for greater time intervals."
"In theory, this filter eliminates the noise completely, as opposed to moving averages, e.g., exponential (EMA) which only offers a modest attenuation effect."
"Regardless of the time frame used, all waves having cycles of less than 10 bars are considered noise."
"Thus, the filter only passes those spectral components whose periods are greater than 10 bars."
Note that the period of 10 bars is a default value which can be customized using the ` cutoff length ` input parameter.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to which the filter is applied.
` cutoff length ` | Maximum period for a wave cycle to be considered noise.

Probability Analysis Economic Data Tab ## Technical Analysis # VolumeZoneOscillator ## Description The Volume Zone Oscillator (VZO) is a technical indicator analyzing volume changes in relation to certain levels (zones).
"Unlike VolumeOsc , the VZO uses price data along with volume."
"Two averages are calculated for the VZO: the first one is price related EMA of volume, the second is general EMA of volume."
"The first EMA takes into account volume with sign like OnBalanceVolume : the volume is considered negative when the Close price of the corresponding bar is lower than that of the previous bar, and positive otherwise."
"Once these averages are calculated, their percentage ratio is the resulting plot."
"Several levels are introduced to analyze the VZO plot: ""+60"", ""+40"", ""+15"", ""-5"", ""-40"", and ""-60""."
These numbers represent corresponding percentage values.
"For additional confirmation, it is suggested that the VZO plot be accompanied with 60 period EMA and 14 period ADX ."
These two studies are used for checking trend existence and direction.
"ADX values higher than 18 suggest that the market is trending, otherwise the non-trending mode is spotted."
"When the market is trending, the trend direction can be defined using the EMA: the price crossing above the EMA suggests the uptrend, otherwise the downtrend is detected."
"When the trend mode and direction are defined, use the crossovers of the VZO with corresponding levels as Buy and Sell signals for long and short positions (see plots' descriptions for details)."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMAs for the oscillator.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` VZO ` | The Volume Zone Oscillator plot.
"` +60 ` | The ""+60"" level."
"Crossing this level from above is considered a Sell signal to close a long position in an uptrend market (ADX > 18, price above the EMA)."
"` +40 ` | The ""+40"" level."
"Crossing this level from above is considered a Sell signal to open a short position in a downtrend market (ADX > 18, price below the EMA)."
It is also considered a Sell signal in a non-trending market (ADX < 18).
"` +15 ` | The ""+15"" level."
Crossing this level from below is considered a Buy signal for a long position in a non-trending market (ADX < 18).
"` -5 ` | The ""-5"" level."
Crossing this level from above is considered a Sell signal for a short position in a non-trending market (ADX < 18).
"` -40 ` | The ""-40"" level."
"Crossing this level from below is considered a Buy signal to open a long position in an uptrend market (ADX > 18, price above the EMA)."
It is also considered a Buy signal in a non-trending market (ADX < 18).
"` -60 ` | The ""-60"" level."
"Crossing this level from below is considered a Buy signal to close a short position in a downtrend market (ADX > 18, price below the EMA)."
` ZeroLine ` | The Zero Level.
"Crossing this level from below is considered a Buy signal to close a short position after a bullish reversal (ADX > 18, price goes above the EMA); crossing this level from above is considered a Sell signal to close a long position after a bearish reversal (ADX > 18, price goes below the EMA)."

"Support and resistance levels are found in relation to the pivot point which is the average of High, Low, and Close prices of the previous period."
See the following table explaining calculation of support and resistance levels.
"Order | Resistance Level | Support Level ---|---|--- First | Above the pivot point, at the distance equal to that between the pivot point and the Low price of the previous period."
"| Below the pivot point, at the distance equal to that between the pivot point and the High price of the previous period."
"Second | Above the pivot point, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"| Below the pivot point, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"Third | Above the second resistance level, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"| Below the second support level, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"Compared to Persons Pivots , Pivot Points uses different determination of weekly and monthly timeframes."
"In Persons Pivots, the last complete time period (week or month) is taken to calculate the levels, while Pivot Points counts these periods back from the last day, so in the latter case, pivot levels are different each day."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` show only today ` | Defines whether to display plots for the whole chart or for the last day only.
` time frame ` | The time frame used to calculate the pivot points.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` R3 ` | The third resistance level.
` R2 ` | The second resistance level.
` R1 ` | The first resistance level.
` PP ` | The pivot point.

"For a Put option, the code of the next option with higher strike will be returned; for a Call option, this function will return the code of the next option with lower strike."
"Note that, despite the function name, the code of the next option in in-the- money direction is returned, which is not necessarily an in-the-money option."
"## Example AddLabel(yes, ""Next ITM option is"" + GetNextITMOption("".GOOG120317C580"")); This script adds a chart label showing the code of the next Call option for Google in the series with expiration date March 17, 2012, whose strike price is lower than that of the specified one ($580)."
"GetNextExpirationOption GetNextOTMOption with higher strike will be returned; yes, ""Next ITM option is"" + GetNextITMOption("".GOOG120317C580"")); ## Technical Analysis # KlingerOscillator ## Description The Klinger Oscillator measures trends of money flows based upon volume."
It is helpful in both short and long term market analysis.
"The Klinger Oscillator is calculated using three values: the High-Low price range, volume, and Accumulation/Distribution."
"Accumulation takes place if typical price of the current bar is higher than that of the previous, and Distribution is observed when the current typical price is lower than that of the previous bar."
"If the typical prices are equal, the existing trend is maintained."
The oscillator is calculated as the difference between two EMAs of volume force: 34 period EMA and 55 period EMA.
Volume force is defined as volume multiplied by coefficient depending on Accumulation/Distribution data and preceding trend.
The primary plot is accompanied with trigger line which is EMA of Klinger Oscillator (period is equal to 13 by default).
"In price uptrend, it is considered a Buy signal when Klinger Oscillator has extremely low negative value, turns up and crosses the trigger line."
"Conversely, in downtrend, the Sell signal is suggested when Klinger Oscillator rises to extremely high level, turns down, and crosses the trigger line."
An 89 period EMA is recommended for defining trend direction.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` ma length ` | The number of bars to calculate the EMA for trigger line.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` KVOsc ` | The Klinger Oscillator plot.
` TriggerLine ` | The trigger line.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

"It appears as a series of three bottoms with the middle one being the lowest (still called the ""head"", even though its direction is the opposite)."
"While the first and the third bottoms (the ""shoulders"") need to be higher than the head, it is not required that they are of the same height."
"On the contrary, stats show that patterns where the left shoulder is higher than the right are slightly better in post-breakout performance."
"Similarly, the line that connects pattern tops, called ""the neckline"", does not need to be strictly horizontal, necklines with a slope downward add to the pattern performance."
"When a Head and Shoulders formation is seen in a downtrend, it signifies a major reversal."
"Just like in the straight Head and Shoulders pattern, the strength of this reversal, measured as the rise amount after breakout, is proportional to the decline before pattern emergence: stronger preceding trends are prone to more dramatic reversals."
"Volume trends are exactly the same as in Head and Shoulders: it is usually the highest at the left and trending downward; however, this describes better conditions (as opposed to Head and Shoulders where volume uptrends are usually preferred)."
"While sharing the Head and Shoulders geometry principles, the inverse pattern is statistically less reliable."
"On the other hand, its tendency toward throwbacks is significantly less expressed than the tendency toward pullbacks in plain Head and Shoulders."
Head and Shoulders Pennant # Glossary G A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z ## Gamma An approximation of the change in the delta of an option relative to a change in the price of the underlying stock when all other factors are held constant.
"Gamma is accurate for small changes in the price of the underlying stock, but is expressed in terms of a change in delta for a 1 point move in the stock."
"For example, if a call has a delta of .49 and a gamma of .03, if the stock moves down 1 point, the call delta would be .46 (.49 + (.03 x -$1.00))."
"Generated by a mathematical model, delta depends on the stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rates, dividends, and time to expiration."

"Once the three values are calculated, their sum divided by 2 is the final result."
The output is said to be consistent with candlestick patterns ; there are several candlestick patterns which can be represented numerically using values of Price Action Indicator.
Low negative values imply that a bearish trend reversal might occur; these values are peculiar to the Shooting Star candlestick pattern.
"On the contrary, high positive values of the study might signify a bullish reversal; this is consistent with the Hammer candlestick pattern."

## How to thinkorswim # Using Studies and Strategies The thinkorswim platform provides you with hundreds of predefined technical indicators and a built-in study editor so you can create your own.
Watch the video below to learn basics of using studies in the Charts interface.
Continue reading if you need more in-depth information.
"All Videos Basically speaking, there are two types of technical indicators in thinkorswim: studies and strategies (for now, were not taking into account the multitude of the pre-defined patterns , as there is a separate section in the manual dedicated to this kind of analysis technique)."
Studies are technical indicators that calculate certain values for each bar on chart.
"Strategies, on the other hand, will also provide you with historical trade signals: time and price points on chart where a certain price-based condition was satisfied."
Strategies can also be back-tested: you can view a report that calculates the hypothetical profit/loss value that would have been actual if the signals given by the strategy were real buy and sell orders.
Operations with Studies and Strategies 1\.
"To add a study, click Studies in the Charts header."
"Click Add Study or Quick Study , find the group the study belongs to and select it from the list."

SwamiVolume SymbolRelation ## Technical Analysis # AccumulationDistributionStrat ## Description Accumulation/Disribution is a strategy created by Domenico D'Errico in attempt to identify and utilize market phases stipulated by Dow theory.
The strategy recognizes accumulation and distribution market phases based on range or average true range compression and adds simulated buy and sell orders accordingly.
"The strategy recognizes the accumulation market phase if the price is in downtrend, but the price move is slowing down while gaining short-term momentum."
"Conversely, the distribution phase is recognized if the price is in uptrend while losing short-term momentum and the overall price move shows signs of slowing down."
"The slowing down of the price move, or range compression, is evaluated by the Accumulation/Distribution study."
Two types of range measurement can be used with this study: high-low range or average true range.
A simulated buy to open order is added if all of the following conditions are fulfilled: Range compression is detected.
A higher 12-week low is registered.
The close price breaks above a recent highest level.
Average volume has recently increased.
Two past average values are compared: a recent average value and a value that is offset from it by the average length.
A simulated sell to close order is added when the close price falls below a recent low.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | Defines the period for which the high-low range or the average true range is calculated.
` factor ` | Defines the upper limit (exclusive) of the recent to past range ratio for the range compression to be recognized.
` vol ratio ` | Defines the lower limit (exclusive) of the recent to past average volume ratio for the volume condition to be fulfilled.
` vol avg length ` | Defines the length of the moving average calculated for volume.
` vol delay ` | Defines the offset from the current bar to find the recent value of the average volume.
` mode ` | Defines whether to use the high-low range or the average true range in the calculations.

## What's a candlestick pattern?
A candlestick pattern is a specific configuration of chart candles of certain shapes that were sometimes seen together on charts in a certain trend development scenario: continuation or reversal.
Statistical consistency and logical rationale have made candlestick patterns a popular analysis tool in the Western world -- after centuries of usage in Japanese markets.
"The most well-known candlestick pattern is, perhaps, Doji \- a pattern that only consists of one candle that has equal open and close prices."
This pattern is believed by many to indicate a soon trend reversal.
## Where do I find these?
1.
Make sure the Charts tab is open.
Click Patterns in the upper right corner of the working area.
2.
Click Select patterns...
The Select Patterns dialog window will appear.
3.
Select the Candlestick tab.
You will see a list of all available candlestick patterns (both pre-defined and those previously added by you).
4.
Click Create... below the list.
This will open the Candlestick Pattern Editor window.
## How do I create a candlestick pattern?
"Let's say your pattern consists of seven candles: the first two are up candles and the second one closes at a higher level than the first; then we have two candles whose direction and price levels do not matter to us; then there is a down candle which closes below the second candle's open; and, finally, there is a Doji that opens below the previous candle's low."
Here's an algorithm of creating such a pattern: 1\.
"In the Candlestick Pattern Editor window, you can see a big gray candle with a icon inside of it."
Click on this candle and choose Up candle from the menu.
This will add the first Up candle.
2\.
"As our second candle is also an Up candle, repeat step 1."
Note how the candles are both displayed on the pattern chart and listed in the Conditions area.
"If you change your mind about what the candle direction should be, click on the center point of that candle on the pattern chart or just use its drop-down in the Conditions area."
Either action will prompt you to specify the candle direction.
"If you need to delete a candle, click on its center point and choose Delete or just click in the corresponding row of the Conditions area."
3\.
"Next, let's add two candles without a specified direction."
Click on the gray candle and choose Mixed candles .
"By default, the editor will add 5 random candles: as we only need two, go to #3 in the Conditions area and change the Total to 2."
"Note that you can still specify how many Up, Down, and Doji candles you need in this random set in the same row of the Conditions area."
4\.
"Next, we will need a Down candle and a Doji candle."
"To do so, click on the gray candle again or use the icon in the Conditions area header."
5\.
"Now, let's specify the price relations between the candles."
"First, move your cursor over the first candle: you will see five points appear above it."
"The point in the middle can be used for modification of the candle direction, while four others define price levels of open, high, low, and close."
Drag the close price point - to the close price point of the second candle.
Release the mouse button and then click Less .
You will see a line that connects the two price points with the word Greater in the middle of it.
"In our case, this means that the close of candle 2 is greater than the close of candle 1."
6\.
Specify the relation between candle 2 and candle 4 by clicking on the second candle's open and dragging it to the fourth candle's close.
Choose Greater .
Note that the relations can be modified or deleted by either clicking on their respective icons on the pattern chart or using the list in the Conditions area.
7\.
"Specify the price relation for the Doji candle: drag its low price point to the ""Drop here to set as lowest"" area that appears at the bottom of the pattern chart."
"By default, this will set this low price as the lowest in the entire pattern; however, you can make it the lowest among a number of preceding candles by specifying that number in the corresponding line of the Conditions area."
"Note that at any point of pattern creation you can change the order of candles by dragging-and-dropping them on the pattern chart (this will, however, dismiss all the pricing conditions previously defined for the affected candles)."
8\.
"Note that in addition to the mentioned price relations between candles, there are also ""Equal"", ""Greater than or equal"", ""Less than or equal"", ""Not equal"" , and ""Near"" (about equal)."
"Be sure to use these relations, should your pattern need one."
9\.
You can also view the thinkScript code that corresponds to your pattern by moving to the thinkScript tab.
10\.
Customize the display of the signals to be provided by the candlestick pattern: choose an icon and a color in the corresponding controls above the pattern chart.
11\.
Click Save .
Your pattern will be added to both Available patterns and Displayed patterns lists.
12\.
"Once you've finished with your pattern, click OK so the system will start looking for your pattern on chart."
13\.
You can also use your custom candlestick patterns as study filters in Stock Hacker.
"To do so, navigate to the Stock Hacker tab and click Add study filter ."
"Click on the default study in the filter and replace it with your candlestick pattern, which you will find in the User Defined group."

"Like in all Thermo Mode specific studies, shorter lookback periods reflect recent changes, middle range periods are used for confirmation, and the longest ones signify possibility of continuation."
Swami Market Mode calculation is based on comparing the trend slope on a time period to the peak-to-peak amplitude on the same period.
"Ratios higher than +1 are indicative of uptrend, ratios lower than -1 suggest downtrend, while values in between signify that the swing mode is on."
"In default color scheme, uptrend is indicated by green areas, downtrend by red areas, and swing mode by yellow."

EightMonthAvg ERTrend ## Technical Analysis # Chapter 12.
"Past/Future Offset and Prefetch ## Past Offset When referencing historical data (described in chapter 10 ), you should keep in mind a feature called past offset."
Let's study the following example.
plot CloseOffset = close[5]; This example script will plot the Close price five bars prior to the current bar.
"This calculation mechanism is obvious for bars from the sixth through the last one, but how exactly this plot is going to be calculated for the first five bars?"
"Past offset is a number of additional bars from the past, necessary for calculating a study."
"In this very example, the past offset is equal to five; it means that the calculation will start with the sixth bar using price data obtained from the first five bars."
"However, if additional historical data is available for the chart you are currently using, it will be used for calculating the plot for the first five bars."
"When scripting a study, you might need to use several different past offsets for expressions in your script."
"Let's analyze the following example: declare lower; def x = x[1] + 1; plot Average11 = Average(close, 11); plot myline = x; In this script, variable ` x ` uses a past offset equal to 1, while function ` Average ` uses a past offset equal to 10."
"In thinkScript, the highest past offset overrides lower offsets in the same study, which means that all expressions in a single study will have the same (highest) past offset."
"In the example script, this offset is equal to 10 and is assigned to both expressions."
"This is why the myline plot will return 11 for the first bar, not 2 as one might have expected."
Note that past offset might affect calculation mechanism of some studies due to setting a single intialization point for all expressions.
"However, if for some reason you need an independent initialization point for an expression, you can use the ` CompoundValue ` function that you are already familiar with: declare lower; def x = compoundValue(1, x[1]+1, 1); plot ATR = average(TrueRange(high, close, low), 10); plot myline = x; This would explicitly set the value for the ` myline ` plot for the first bar, and all other values of this plot will be calculated corresponding to it."
## Prefetch Prefetch is a property characteristic of Exponential Moving Averages that consists in fetching historical data prior to beginning of time period.
This property enables these functions to be range independent.
"Three thinkScript functions use prefetch: ExpAverage , EMA2 , and WildersAverage ."
The number of bars needed for each of these to become range-independent can be calculated as follows: ExpAverage: 4length bars Ema2: 8/ + 4 bars WildersAverage: 7length bars Note that ` WildersAverage ` also uses a past offset which is equal to ` (length 1) ` bars; two others have a zero past offset.
"There is a notable difference between the past offset and prefetch: when historical data is not available, functions that only use prefetch will have the first bar on chart as an initialization point, while functions using past offset will be initialized at a bar whose number is equal to the past offset value."
"## Future Offset Unlike the two previously described features, future offset affects re- calculation of values for the most recent bars."
"When the future offset is equal to zero, e.g., in plot data = close; the only value that has to be re-calculated is that of the last bar on chart."
"However, if we specify a future offset in this expression using a negative index: plot data = close [-1]; the study will wait for a new quote in order to calculate the value for the second latest bar."
"Basically, this script plots the close price of the next bar as soon as there is a quote for it."
Some functions use the future offset (and increase its value for the whole script) without waiting for the upcoming quotes.
"These functions produce values based on events, e.g., conference calls or earnings, scheduled for a future date."
"To see how it works, refer, for example, to the GetEventOffset function article."
"Apart from its influence on recent values, future offset can be useful in a number of specific tasks."
"For example, it is widely employed to indicate the level of the last close price across several most recent bars: input lineLength = 4; def lastBar = !IsNaN(close) && IsNaN(close[-1]); def lastClose = if lastBar then close else lastClose[1]; plot data = if IsNaN(close[-lineLength-1]) then lastClose[-lineLength] else Double.NaN; data.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.HORIZONTAL); data.SetDefaultColor(Color.BLUE); This script records the last close price and plots it as a line across the last 4 bars, the number being customizable via the input parameter."
In case youre wondering what those ` IsNaN ` and !
"` IsNaN ` are, refer to the Appendix D ."
"Here, these constants are used for finding the last bar on chart."
"We strongly recommend that you use the IsNaN + future offset method for detection of the last bar, not the popular HighestAll method: def isLastBar = BarNumber() == HighestAll(if !IsNaN(close) then BarNumber() else Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY); plot LastBarSignal = isLastBar; LastBarSignal.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); The script above makes the study dependent on all bars of chart, which may result in productivity problems."
"Besides, the re-calculation mode will be set to once per bar instead of once per quote, which may also affect the output in an unwanted way."
"Should you need to fix the last bar in your script, use the future offset version: def isLastBar = !IsNaN(close) and IsNaN(close[-1]); plot LastBarSignal = isLastBar; LastBarSignal.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); Three last chapters only covered time referencing: finding historical values, using secondary aggregation, or using additional bars from the past."
"However, there are several other things you might need to reference in your script; all of these will be explained in the next chapter ."

Spotting such formations at early phases can be a powerful method of trend reversal forecasting.
"In order to find semi-cup formations, this study employs the following algorithm."
"Semi-cup formation occurs in a sequence of bars, the first of which has the highest price of specified type compared to the others; this sequence can be defined by minimum and maximum length."
The price of the first bar must be greater than that of the last bar multiplied by user-defined factor.
"Once the sequence is found, the price data is converted into logarithmic scale by taking a natural logarithm of price of each bar."
"After conversion, directional index is calculated."
The directional index is a simplified version of DMI using the logarithm instead of price itself and simple smoothing instead of Wilder's average.
The sequence is then divided into five equal parts.
"Analyzing these parts, the semi-cup formation is recognized if: Logarithmic price values of the last two parts are in the lower 40% of the range between the highest and lowest logarithms; Logarithmic price values of the middle part are in the lower 60% of this range; The first two parts have the directional index greater than 25; The last three parts have the directional index lower than 25."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price subjected to logarithmic scale conversion.
` min length ` | The minimum number of bars allowed in the sequence.
` max length ` | The maximum number of bars allowed in the sequence.
` factor ` | The factor by which the price of the first bar exceeds that of the last bar in the detected sequence.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` SemiCup ` | The dot marking the last bar in the sequence.
` Curve ` | The curve of the last semi-cup formation occurred.

"The ` eventType ` parameter uses an Events constant to specify the type of the event: conference call, dividend, split, or earnings announcement."
"The ` numberOfEventsToSkip ` parameter defines which event of the specified type should be used: negative values define the number of the event in retrospective order, other values define upcoming events with zero corresponding to the closest one."
"Note that the sign of the value returned by this function is opposite to that of the ` numberOfEventsToSkip ` parameter: positive values for negative ` numberOfEventsToSkip ` , negative for zero or positive ` numberOfEventsToSkip ` ."
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- eventType | Events.DIVIVDEND | Defines the type of event since/until which bars are counted.
"numberofEventsToSkip | 0 | If negative, defines number of a past event, otherwise, number of the upcoming one."
Zero value corresponds to the closest upcoming event.

"GetEstimatedEarnings GetSplitDenominator bars ago""); ## Technical Analysis # CumulativeOvernightVolume ## Description The Cumulative Overnight Volume is a technical indicator that detects unusually high volume during the overnight trading session."
"Based on the observation that nightly volume is very often proportionate to both daily volume and daily volatility, the study can be used when assessing possible daily price range."
"Mathematically, the study compares the volume traded last night (from midnight to 8:30 am Central Standard Time (CST)) to the average nightly volume over the last five days."
"Note that since thinkScript uses timestamps based in Eastern Standard Time (EST), the default numbers in the input parameters are adjusted accordingly."
Note also that the study will only work on intraday charts with a maximum aggregation period of 1 hour.
The values produced by the Cumulative Overnight Volume study can be used with the First Hour Breakout strategy to detect whether a statistical volatility bias is confirmed.
The statistical volatility bias can be detected if the volume traded last night is greater than the average nightly volume over the last five days.
"On the chart, the cumulative overnight volume is displayed as a series of histograms and the last bar in each histogram represents the total volume traded during the respective overnight trading session."
The average volume is plotted across the histogram as long horizontal dashes.
"If the overnight volume is greater than the average, the last bar in the corresponding histogram is shown in a different color so that the statistical volatility bias can be easily spotted."
"Note that when the Cumulative Overnight Volume is added to a chart, the price plot will use different colors for different trading periods during the day."
The following periods will be distinguished: Night session from midnight: midnight till 8:30 am CST First hour: 8:30 am CST till 9:30 am CST Main session: 9:30 am CST till 3:15 pm CST The rest of the trading day: 3:15 pm CST till midnight You can turn off the price plot coloring using the study input parameters.
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` night session from midnight ` | Defines the start of the midnight trading session in the EST time zone, 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` first hour trading ` | Defines the start of the day trading session in the EST time zone, 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` main session ` | Defines the start of the main session (by default, one hour after the market opens) in the EST time zone 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` night session from main session end ` | Defines the end of the main session in the EST time zone, 24-hour hhmm notation."
` paint bars ` | Defines whether or not to color the price plot according to the trading period during the day (see the study description).
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` CumulativeOvernightVolume ` | A histogram that illustrates the cumulative volume traded last night.
` AverageOvernightVolume ` | The average nightly volume over the last five days.

## Profit/Loss (P/L) % P/L % calculates the percentage of money made or lost as a function of your execution price.
This takes P/L open as the numerator and your execution price as the denominator.
"Please keep in mind that this will only calculate the P/L of single options and thus, excludes spreads."
## Profit/Loss (P/L) Day P/L Day is the amount of money made or lost on your position from last night's close to the current mark plus any intra-day profit and loss.
You can see the current price for any stock or option in your position on the 'Position Statement'.

"## Profit/Loss (P/L) Differential (Diff) To view historical account information for a specified date range, navigate to the account statement sub tab and enter the desired date range."
The Profits and Losses section will display gains or losses for only that date range.
This allows the user an easy way to view profit and loss for a specific time period.
"This value, Profit and Loss Differential (P/L Diff), is calculated as follows: P/L Diff = P/L YTD of the end date - P/L YTD of the start date, where start date and end date refer to the border values of time interval filter currently applied to Account Statement."
In case of P/L YTD of the start date is N/A system shall use P/L YTD of the end date value as the P/L Diff value.

Someone who is short the put is obligated to take delivery of (buy) the underlying stock at the option's strike price from the owner of the put if the owner exercises his right.
## Technical Analysis # RelativeVolumeStDev ## Description The Relative Volume StDev is a support-resistance technical indicator developed by Melvin E. Dickover.
"Unlike many conventional support and resistance indicators, the Relative Volume StDev takes into account price- volume behavior in order to detect the supply and demand pools."
"These pools are marked by Defended Price Lines (DPLs), also introduced by the author."
"In mathematical sense, the Relative Volume StDev is calculated as the ratio of the volume to its simple moving average (SMA) , expressed in standard deviations."
This value is plotted as a histogram; its bars are highlighted when the volume is unusually large.
"According to the author, this happens if the indicator value exceeds 2.0, thus signifying that a possible DPL is present."
DPLs are horizontal lines that run across the chart (feel free to use a Price Level drawing for that) at levels defined by following conditions: Overlapping bars.
"If the indicator spike (i.e., indicator is above 2.0 or a custom value) corresponds to a price bar overlapping the previous one, the previous close can be used as the DPL value."
Very large bars.
"If the indicator spike corresponds to a price bar of a large size, use its close price as the DPL value."
Gapping bars.
"If the indicator spike corresponds to a price bar gapping from the previous bar, the DPL value will depend on the gap size."
Small gaps can be ignored: the author suggests using the previous close as the DPL value.
"When the gap is big, the close of the latter bar is used instead."
Clustering spikes.
"If the indicator spikes come in clusters, use the extreme close or open price of the bar corresponding to the last or next to last spike in cluster."
DPLs can be used as support and resistance levels.
"In order confirm and refine them, it is suggested that you use the Relative Volume StDev together with the FreedomOfMovement , another indicator developed by Melvin E. Dickover."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of both the standard deviation and the simple moving average.
` num dev ` | The critical indicator value exceeding which will indicate the spike.
` allow negative values ` | Defines whether or not to display negative values of the indicator.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` RelVol ` | The Relative Volume StDev histogram.

An ideal - according to this study - pattern comprises several consecutive highs or lows reaching the extremum value and then reversing the direction.
"However, non-ideal fractals are also recognized."
"In non-ideal fractals, the described sequence is interrupted by a new high or low of exactly the same value as the extremum reached: the pattern is completed after the necessary number of successive lower highs or higher lows, depending on the direction of the pattern."
## Input Parameters ` sequence count ` | Defines by how many lower highs/higher lows the extremum value should be preceded and followed.
---|--- ## Plots ` UpFractal ` | The bearish Williams Fractal candlestick pattern.
---|--- ` DownFractal ` | The bullish Williams Fractal candlestick pattern.
TriStar ZigZagStepPattern ## Technical Analysis # Inertia ## Description The Inertia study plots the linear regression curve of the Relative Volatility Index using the least-square approximation method.
"Much like the Relative Volatility Index itself, Inertia can be used as a confirming indicator."
Readings higher than 50 indicate that the volatility is more to the upside.
Readings lower than 50 indicate that the direction of volatility is to the downside.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the linear regression curve.
` rvi length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the Relative Volatility Index.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Inertia ` | The Inertia plot.
` MiddleLine ` | The neutral volatility level.

AUTOMATIC ## Technical Analysis # SeasonalTrading ## Description Seasonal Trading is a strategy designed by Perry J. Kaufman in an attempt to explore seasonal patterns in stock price.
The strategy analyzes monthly price action using the Monthly Seasonality study and adds simulated buy and sell orders based on the resulting values.
"As monthly action is taken into account, this strategy is to be used on monthly charts only."
### Calculation The price data is run through Monthly Seasonality to reveal seasonal patterns and identify the months with the highest and the lowest frequency of positive returns.
The default level of high positive-return frequency is 75.
"For low positive-return frequency, the default level is 25."
The frequency is calculated for each month over the last four years by default.
### Simulated orders Seasonal Trading adds simulated orders according to the following rules: A Buy simulated order is added at the end of a month with a consistently low frequency of positive returns.
A Sell simulated order is added at the end of a month with a consistently high frequency of positive returns.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` years ` | The period for which the frequencies of positive returns for each month are to be calculated.
` high frequency ` | The minimum high-frequency level.
` low frequency ` | The maximum low-frequency level.

Strategy Roller The Strategy Roller is a feature of the thinkorswim platform that can be used to help manage ... ## How to thinkorswim # Range Charts Range charts represent price action in terms of price accumulation.
Two modes of range aggregation are available in Charts: Range Bars and Renko Bars .
You can set up range aggregation when selecting a time frame for your chart.
Setting up the chart time frame is discussed in the next article .
The mode of the range aggregation can be selected on the Time axis tab of the Chart Settings dialog.
1\.
"Range Bars In the Range Bars mode, a new bar (or candlestick, line section, etc.)"
is plotted after a specified price range has been accumulated.
"Each new bar opens at the previous bar's close price, which coincides with either high or low of that same bar, depending on its direction."
"You can use the following chart types with this aggregation mode: Bar, Candle, Candle trend, Heikin Ashi, Line, or Area."
Range Bars are used by default when you enable range aggregation.
2\.
"Renko Bars Renko Bars are plotted as ""bricks""."
"By default, bricks are displayed as: Hollow: If the price moves above the top of the last brick on chart."
Filled: If the price moves below the last brick on chart.
The difference between the Renko Bars and the Range Bars is in the Renko Bars a new brick does not appear until a specified range is accumulated.
"For example, on a five-point chart, the price rising from 95 to 102 produces a hollow brick from 95 to 100, however, a hollow brick ranging from 100 to 105 is not drawn."
The only exception to the above example is the last bar on the chart; it always indicates the most recent price changes and is shown as incomplete until the necessary range is accumulated.
Note that you can only use the Candle chart type with this aggregation mode.
"The price action is always displayed as bricks, i.e., candles without wicks (shadows)."
"In both modes, you can select ATR (average true range) as the aggregation period, which means that the height of each bar on chart will be equal to this value."
"As average true range is based on actual symbol price data, using it as the aggregation period produces the optimal quantity of bars."
"## Visualization Specifics Please note that based on the time interval and the price range set as the aggregation period, range charts may have the following data limitations: 1."
"You can view up to 40,000 bars on a single chart."
"If the price range is too small, the chart time interval may not be available in full."
"In this case, consider increasing the price range."
2.
"For longer chart time intervals, the older the data is, the less precise the visualization could be: Range bars and volume bars for the last seven astronomical days (current day included) are created based on tick-level data."
Range bars and volume bars that are 7 to 14 astronomical days old are created based on 1-minute aggregates.
Range bars and volume bars that are 14 to 194 astronomical days old are created based on 1-hour aggregates.
Range bars and volume bars that are older than 194 astronomical days are created based on daily aggregates.
"Range bars based on 1-minute, 1-hour, or daily aggregates are built in the following order: open price high or low price (whichever is closer to open) high or low price (whichever is farther from open) close price Volume bars that are created from 1-minute, 1-hour, or daily aggregates use the following calculation algorithm."
"If there is an aggregate with a range that can accommodate several range bars, the volume of that bar is distributed evenly among all the range bars based on it."
3.
"If ATR is selected as the aggregation period, the bars from today are excluded from the calculation and midnight Central Standard Time (CST) is used to demarcate today's bars from yesterday's bars."
"In addition, ATR calculation is adjusted based on the chart time interval you are currently using: If the time interval is less than or equal to nine days, ATR is calculated over seven last astronomical days based on one-minute price aggregates."
"If the time interval is less than or equal to 150 days, ATR is calculated over 7 last astronomical days based on 1-hour price aggregates."
"If the time interval is greater than 150 days, ATR is calculated over the last 14 astronomical days based on 1-day price aggregates."
"Setting up Chart Time Frame Chart Drawings iPad Chart Drawings iPad Analyze for Mobile - iPad ## Technical Analysis # Channel Down The Channel Down pattern is identified when there are two parallel lines, both moving down to the right across respective peaks (upper line) and bottoms (lower line)."
"The upper line is identified first, as running along the lows: it defines the trendline."
"The lower line (or, the channel line) is identified as parallel to the trendline, running across the first prominent bottom."
"When in the channel, prices are expected to bounce off both upper and lower boundaries; the more such reversals occur, the more reliable the pattern."
"Breakouts from the Channel Down can occur in both upward and downward directions, having exactly the opposite meanings."
"When the price breaks through the trendline, it might indicate an important, sometimes a severe change in trend."
"Breaking through the channel line, on the contrary, suggests acceleration of the existing trend."
"Note, however, that just like all the other patterns, channels might be prone to false or premature breakouts, which means that price sometimes retreats back into the channel."
Another strategy of using the Channel Down is to identify where the price fails to reach the lower line.
"As opposed to breaking through this line, the failure to reach it often signifies trend exhaustion."
This could be an early warning that the trend is going to reverse: the breach of the trendline may be more likely to happen.

You can use both Aggregation Period constants and pre-defined string values (e.g.
"` Day ` , ` 2 Days ` , ` Week ` , ` Month ` , etc.)"
as valid parameters for the aggregation period.
The full list of the pre-defined string values can be found in the Referencing Secondary Aggregation article.
"Valid parameters for the price type are: ` LAST ` , ` ASK ` , ` BID ` , and ` MARK ` ."
"Alternatively, you can use the PriceType constants ."
"Note that for non-Forex symbols, the last three are only supported on intraday charts with time interval not greater than 15 days."
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- symbol | current symbol | Defines symbol for which the price is returned.

It measures correlation between price actions of currency futures.
"In order to use the Multi-Currency Correlation Oscillator properly, the following needs to be defined: whether the currency pairs are moving in the same direction or opposite directions."
Pairs that move in the same direction can provide entry or exit signals when they have correlated moves.
"Conversely, for opposite-direction pairs, the signals might be looked for when the pairs move away from each other."
"When calculating correlation coefficient, the Multi-Currency Correlation Oscillator takes into account Open and Close prices of futures contracts corresponding to either currency in the pair."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` first currency ` | Defines the first currency futures.

"It comprises five plots, two of which, Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B, are prolonged 26 bars forward by default, thus showing expected trend behavior."
"Three other plots, Tenkan, Kijun, and Chikou, are used as signal, confirmation, and support/resistance aid lines."
The Tenkan line represents the arithmetic mean of the highest High and the lowest Low over a specified time period (9 bars by default).
The Kijun line is calculated similarly using the 26 bars period by default.
The Chikou line represents the current Close price plot projected 26 bars back by default.
"Once the primary lines are plotted, the study calculates the Senkou spans."
The Senkou Span A is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the Tenkan and the Kijun.
This line is plotted 26 bars ahead.
The Senkou Span B is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the highest High and the lowest Low over 52 bars and is plotted 26 bars ahead.
"Then the space between the two lines, so-called Kumo, is colored in respect to the defined trend."
The trend is defined as bullish at the Kumo section where Senkou Span B line is below the Span A line and this section is colored yellow by default.
"Conversely, if the Senkou Span B line surpasses the Span A line, it is considered a bearish sign and the section is colored red by default."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` tenkan period ` | The number of bars used to calculate the Tenkan plot.
"` kijun period ` | The number of bars used to calculate Kijun, Span A, Span B, and Chikou plots."
"## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Tenkan ` | The Tenkan plot, used as a signal line."
"` Kijun ` | The Kijun plot, used as a confirmation line."
` Span A ` | The Senkou Span A plot.

"ARROW_UP ## How to thinkorswim Area Chart Bar Chart Candle Chart Candle Trend Chart Equivolume Chart Heikin Ashi Chart Line Chart # Equivolume Chart The Equivolume chart consists of rectangle-shaped bars, or ""boxes"", without gaps between them."
"The top side of each box is drawn at the level of the high price registered on the aggregation period, and the bottom side at the low price level."
"The widths of each box is proportional to the volume traded during the aggregation period: the higher the volume, the wider the box."
"If volume data is not available for the specified symbol, all boxes are plotted having the same width."
"Equivolume chart does not show the open price, but the close price level can be displayed, if preferred, as a horizontal line in the box."
"Incorporating volume into the price data makes it easier to search for confirmation of trend reversals, support and resistance breaks, or buying/selling pressure."
The latter is best estimated with the close price display on as multiple studies use its position within the range as an indication of whether the buyers or sellers are in control.
Plotting the close price in the Equivolume boxes also serves as a visual reference of trend strength or weakness.
"## Algorithm The boxes are filled with the same color as the borderline: the ""up-tick"" color if close price is greater than the previous close price, or the ""down- tick"" color if it is less."
"If these two values are equal, the box is outlined and filled with the ""neutral-tick"" color."
"If you choose to display the close price, the boxes will be partially filled: for the up-tick boxes, the system fills the area below the close price; in the down-tick boxes, the area above the close price is filled."
Neutral-tick boxes are left unfilled.
Note that displaying the close price is enabled by default.
The color scheme of the Equivolume chart can be customized in the Chart Settings dialog.

"The Stoch plot is calculated as the percent ratio between two sums: sum of _(osc - ll)_ values and that of _(hh - ll)_ values, both sums found on the ""sum length"" period."
DMI Stochastic Extreme study finds crossovers of the Stoch plot with Overbought and Oversold levels and marks them with arrows.
"According to Barbara Star's article ""The DMI Stochastic"", not each arrow should be interpreted as a Buy or Sell signal; the author suggests using them along with DMI Oscillator instead."
"When the DMI Oscillator is positive, up arrows might suggest a Buy signal; when the DMI oscillator is negative, down arrow might be considered a Sell signal."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars with which the DMI oscillator is calculated.
` high low length ` | The period on which highest and lowest values of DMI oscillator are found.
` sum length ` | The number of bars for which the sums of values are calculated.

"Briefly, a watch list is a collection of symbols grouped together along with market data of respective instruments."
"Sometimes, watch lists include or even completely consist of companies or derivatives that might be interesting to traders."
"They can also be constituents of an index like NASDAQ 100, the Dow Jones Industrials, or the S&P 500, to name a few."
"It is also possible to have symbols that are indicators of certain economic trends or industry groups which are not directly tradable, but have an impact on products that are."
"In the header, you can find four controls: the watch list selector, the _up/down arrow_ _control _ , the _'_ _clip'_ _icon _ , and the Show actions button _ ."
_ Here is a breakdown of what these buttons are for: The watch list selector allows you to switch between your watch lists.
"Beside your personal watch lists, you can switch to any of the public, Lovers and losers, Top 10, and industry-based ones."
"In the same menu, you can also view your portfolio watch list, i.e., the watch list of symbols that have positions in the currently selected account."

"However, their coloring algorithms are different."
The coloring is applied based on the open and the close prices on both the current aggregation period and the two adjacent aggregation periods.
"## Algorithm A candle is outlined in the ""border-up"" color if the current close price is higher than that on the previous time period."
"Conversely, if it is lower, the candle is outlined in the ""border-down"" color."
"If the two close prices are equal or if the candle is the first on the chart, the candle is outlined in the ""neutral-tick"" color."
"If a candle outlined in the ""border-up"" color has the close price lower than the open price, it is filled with the ""fill-up"" color."
"Otherwise, it is left unfilled."
"If a candle outlined in the ""border-down"" color has the close price lower than the open price, it is filled with the ""fill-down"" color."
"Otherwise, it is left unfilled."
"If a candle outlined in the ""neutral-tick"" color has the close price lower than the open price, it is filled with the ""neutral-tick"" color."
"Otherwise, it is left unfilled."
"You cannot disable candle filling for the Candle Trend chart, as it is part of the coloring algorithm."
"To customize fill and color settings of the Candle trend chart, use the Appearance Settings ."
Note that zooming out too far on a Candle Trend chart makes it harder to distinguish candle borders and fill colors.
"In this case, ""fill"" colors are used for filled candles and ""border"" colors are used for the unfilled ones."

## Technical Analysis # MarkerIndicator ## Description The Marker Indicator is a study which is intended to predict trend reversals based on changes of High and Low prices.
It finds two differences: between the current High price and its previous value and between previous Low and its current value.
"If the difference is negative, zero is taken instead."
"After that, 8 period SMA is applied to each difference; the final result is percent ratio of the higher average to the sum of both."
It is considered a signal for a bullish reversal when values fall below 30; bearish reversal might be expected if the indicator surpasses the 70 level.

String Data Conversion ## Technical Analysis # MiddleHighLowMA ## Description The Middle High Low MA (MHL MA) is a trend-following moving average based technical indicator designed by Vitali Apirine.
"Being a combination of a regular and a modified moving average, it provides crossovers that might prove useful in making trading decisions."
The MHL MA consists of two lines: MA and MHL_MA.
"These are moving averages of the same type and length, however, the former is applied to the close price while the latter is applied to the price mid-range."
"The mid-range is defined as the arithmetic mean of the highest high and the lowest low, both found on the same lookback period."
"According to this study, the relation between this period and the moving average length is as follows: a lookback period of 3 to 15 bars is suggested for moving averages with length of up to 50; periods of 15 to 50 bars are to be combined with moving averages as slow as 50 to 200 bars in length."
These numbers are referential and can be easily customized in study input parameters.
Interpretation of the behavior of the two lines follows the common logic of moving average crossovers.
"When MA crosses above MHL_MA, the study suggests an entry."
"Vice versa, MA crossing below MHL_MA might indicate an exit signal."
"The crossovers in this study tend to be produced earlier than those generated by a combination of two regular moving averages, so MHL MA is said to react faster to the price behavior and substantially reduce the lag characteristic of moving averages."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the length for calculation of both moving averages.
---|--- ` high low length ` | Defines the length of the period upon which the highest high and the lowest low prices are found.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
## Plots ` MHL_MA ` | The moving average of the mid-range value.

"The Pair Trading Short strategy adds simulated orders based on the same price ratio and its short and long moving averages calculated in Pair Trading Long, however, the direction of the orders is the opposite."
Conditions are different for each of the three price ratio trending modes.
Trend following mode.
"In the trend following mode, the price ratio shows a clear trend: either bullish or bearish."
Selecting this mode will have the strategy add a sell to open simulated order when the fast moving average crosses above the slow one.
A buy to close simulated order will be added once the fast average crosses below the slow one.
Mean reversion mode.
"In the mean reversion mode, the price ratio shows continuation of a preceding trend after a retracement of about 50%."
Selecting this mode will have the strategy add a sell to open simulated order when the price ratio crosses below its fast moving average.
"Conversely, a buy to close simulated order will be added when it crosses above."
Trend-and-pullback mode.
"In the trend-and-pullback mode, the price ratio shows numerous pullbacks in the main trend."
Selecting this mode will have the strategy add a sell to open simulated order when the price ratio crosses below the fast moving average while being above the slow one.
A buy to close simulated order will be added once the price ratio crosses above the fast average while being below the slow one.
## Input Parameters | ---|--- ` first symbol ` | Defines the primary symbol for the price ratio.

"When applied to waveform-like input data, it ignores value spikes without averaging them."
"Being a recursive method, the filter references its own previous values in the calculation; a similar mechanism is used in the Exponential Moving Average study."
The main purpose of the filter is to pass data with wavelengths shorter than a critical period and to eliminate data with longer wavelengths.
"You can specify a custom critical period in the input parameters; by default, it is set to 12 bars."
"Essentialy, the Recursive Median Filter is the exponential moving average of the median close price."
The smoothing factor is calculated based on a trigonometrical formula that uses the critical period of the filter as the argument.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` lp length ` | The critical period of the filter.
"Data with wavelengths shorter than this will be passed, longer wavelengths will be eliminated."

"To activate the grid, click on the Grid button in the top right corner and select the desirable grid configuration."
"To detach Bookmap, click on the Show Actions Menu button in the top right corner and select Detach."
Components and layout The layout of Bookmap is divided into six components.
You can find brief descriptions of these components below.
1\.
Header .
"Akin to many other interfaces available in thinkorswim, the header in Bookmap contains a symbol selector, the full name of the symbol, the current market price of the selected symbol, and its percentage and absolute change since midnight."
"Note : If you are using the demo version, only certain symbols are available."
"To make most of Bookmap functionality, consider subscribing to the full version."
"In the full version, most stock and futures symbols are available."
2\.
Toolbar .
The buttons on the toolbar enable you to change the display parameters of Bookmap and control the visibility of its elements.
Note that these actions are also available from the Bookmap charts right-click menu.
3\.
Bookmap chart .
"By default, Bookmap chart displays the following components: Heatmap : A color-coded display of the activity of pending orders."
"For each price level that has pending orders, Heatmap displays a horizontal bar colored according to the color-gradient scheme selected on the toolbar."
"Colors on the right-hand end of the gradient correspond to price slices with the highest liquidity, and those on the left-hand end, to the lowest."
Current best Bid/Ask prices : Current best bid and ask prices are plotted in real time across the chart.
"To change the color of either plot, right-click it and go to Colors > Best bid/ask line ."
Choose a color from the color palette by clicking on the sample color box or eyedropper-select a color from your screen.
Volume bars : Volume bars are a representation of the transactions that have taken place on the best bid and ask.
They are shown at the bottom of the chart.
"The color of each bar corresponds to the aggressor side: red is for sell side, and green is for buy side."
The location and height of each bar are defined by settings you can apply using the Volume bars configuration window.
"Volume dots : Volume dots, or spheres, are a representation of the transactions that have taken place on the best bid and ask."
They are shown across the chart.
"The color of each dot corresponds to the aggressor side: red is for sell side, and green is for buy side."
The location and size of each dot are defined by settings you can apply using the Volume dots configuration window.
"You can hide any of the above components by right-clicking on the chart, going to Configure visible components , and de-activating the components you would like to hide."
This menu also allows you to view additional components on the chart: Candlestick chart : Activating this component will overlay the Heatmap with real-time OHLC candles.
Last price : Activating this component will plot the current last price in real time across the chart.
"By default, it is displayed in white."
"To change the color of the plot, right-click it and go to Colors > Last Price ."
Choose a color from the color palette by clicking on the sample color box or eyedropper-select a color from your screen.
VWAP : Activating this component will plot the volume-weighted average price in real time across the chart.

Ladder and columns .
This component displays a price scale broken into price levels and configurable columns.
Each column can be configured to display a certain type of data for each of the price levels.
"The following column types are available: Current Order Book , Volume, Trades Counter, Quotes Counter , and Quotes Delta ."
5\.
Imbalance indicators .
Imbalance indicators are two bars above the chart that display the following data in real time: Order Book Imbalance : The ratio of the difference between the numbers of buy and sell orders to their sum.
Volume Imbalance : The ratio of the difference between buy and sell volumes to their sum.
6\.
CVD pane .
CVD pane is a designated area for the cumulative volume delta (CVD) indicator.
"By default, this pane is hidden."
"To make it visible, click on the v-shaped arrow below the ladder."

Creating Strategies At this very moment we presume that you are able to create a simple technical indicator as the most useful commands have been discussed in previous chapters.
"Lets have a look at what this indicator could look like: input price = close; input length = 20; plot avg = Average(price, length); This script will plot a 20 period SMA of Close price with both length and price adjustable via the input parameters."
"You can also add a declaration stating that this study should be displayed on the lower subgraph, define several variables to be used in calculations, call some tricky mathematical functions, and specify conditions which will provide you with trading signals."
"However, the main part here is the plot whose values are going to be analyzed."
In this chapter we are going to discuss strategies a different type of indicators which have trading signals as the main target of analysis.
These indicators are displayed on the Strategies tab of Edit Studies and Strategies window and this is where they should be added.
"When you add a strategy to chart, Buy and Sell triggers appear in response to the specified conditions (and now you know a lot of ways to specify them; refer to chapter 5 and chapter 6 to refresh your knowledge)."
Strategies also provide you with ability to estimate the Profit/Loss value if you sent orders upon each Buy and Sell signal.
This is what we call backtesting of a strategy: TOS Charts interface allows you to view the performance report upon clicking each signal on chart (the full procedure is described here ).
"As one can expect, strategies are similar to regular studies, but they just have something special to them."
This something is AddOrder function which (if properly used) will turn any technical indicator into trading strategy.
"Now we are going to do it with the script above: input price = close; input length = 20; def avg = Average(price, length); AddOrder(OrderType.BUY_AUTO, price crosses above avg); AddOrder(OrderType.SELL_AUTO, price crosses below avg); Now it is a strategy which will add a Buy signal every time Close price crosses above its 20 period SMA and a Sell signal when it crosses below."
"Aside from the AddOrder function which will be discussed a bit later, we could notice a couple other differences peculiar to strategies."
"First of all, as you can see, this strategy does not have any plots (as the most studies do)."
"This is characteristic of strategies: they do not normally show any plots, however, it wont do any harm if you add a plot or several to this script."
"Secondly, defining the trading condition is crucial: in our case, it is price crossing above or below its SMA."
But the main difference remains the same: the AddOrder function.
"Let us puzzle out its syntax: AddOrder(OrderType.BUY_AUTO, price crosses above avg); AddOrder(OrderType.SELL_AUTO, price crosses below avg); We called this function twice: first for the Buy signal and second for the Sell."
"In order to specify which side of trading is considered, AddOrder function requires an OrderType constant as the first argument."
BUY_AUTO is a constant which AddOrder function uses to add a buying order for entering a new long position or closing a short one.
"Vice versa, SELL_AUTO is used to add a selling order for entering a new short position or closing a long position."
"As you can see, both BUY_AUTO and SELL_AUTO constants open new positions and close previous ones."
"If you prefer a constant which only opens or closes a position, consider using some of the other four: BUY_TO_CLOSE, BUY_TO_OPEN, SELL_TO_CLOSE, and SELL_TO_OPEN."
"While names of the constants speak for themselves, feel free to read more about them in our reference."
The second argument of the function was the condition upon which the order of specified side and position effect will be added.
This order will be added to the next bar after condition is fulfilled.
"When the strategy is applied to chart, each time the condition is fulfilled, an order is displayed."
Orders are shown as up and down arrows above and below the price plot.
"These arrows are also accompanied by position effect, caption, and a tick marking the trading price."
"Appearance of these elements can be customized via the full syntax of the AddOrder function which is just a little bit more complicated than what youve seen before: AddOrder(type, condition, price, tradeSize, tickColor, arrowColor, name); Aside from previously described type and condition, arguments also include price, trade size, tick color, arrow color and name."
"Argument price defines price at which the order is added (by default, it is the Open of the following bar), trade size stands for the number of contracts traded; you can also specify colors for both tick and arrow."
"Colors need to be defined as Color constants, e.g., Color.RED, Color.GREEN, Color.ORANGE, etc."
The full list of color constants can be found here ; usage of these constants will be covered in the next chapter .
"The last argument is name; it defines the caption to be displayed (by default, it is the same as the name of the strategy itself)."

is used in the Volume Zone Oscillator study; ## Technical Analysis # FM_Demodulator2 ## Description The modified FM Demodulator is a technical indicator that singles out the frequency modulation component out of market data cycles.
It does so by applying a hard limiter that eliminates all amplitude information from the market data spectrum.
"Based on signal processing techniques, this indicator can help detect potential turning points in market data."
"As opposed to the plain FM Demodulator , it calculates the hard limiter filter based on the two-bar price momentum instead of the difference between the close and open."
The modified FM Demodulator is calculated as follows: 1.
"Hard limiter is applied to the two-bar close price momentum: the momentum times two is divided by its root mean square, and the results are cut off to fit the -1 to +1 range."
2.
The sum of the four last hard limiter values is found (plot ` Timing ` ).
3.
A simple moving average of the previous result is calculated (plot ` Signal ` ).
4.
The rate of change of the moving average is the resulting indicator (plot ` ROC ` ).
The crossovers of the resulting indicator can help recognize potential entry and exit points.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` signal length ` | The length of the average to calculate the Signal plot with.
` roc length ` | The length of the rate of change to calculate the ROC plot with.
` rms length ` | The length of the root mean square to calculate the hard limiter with.

"The strategy can be used in two modes: with or without the modified FM Demodulator , which is an indicator that singles out the frequency modulation component out of market data cycles."
"In both modes, a buy to open simulated order is added when the rate of change of the signal variable crosses above zero, and a sell to close simulated order is added when the signal variable crosses below zero."
The difference between the two modes is in how the signal variable is calculated.
"In the plain mode, it is an average of the sum of the four last consecutive two-bar price momentums."
"In the FM Demodulator mode, it is an average of the modified FM Demodulators Timing output of the two-bar momentum."

The smoothing coefficient is automatically updated based on the magnitude of price changes.
"In the Deviation-Scaled Moving Average, the standard deviation from the mean is chosen to be the measure of this magnitude."
The resulting indicator provides substantial smoothing of the data even when price changes are small while quickly adapting to these changes.
The smoothing coefficient is calculated using the following algorithm: 1.
A two-bar close price difference is found and run through the SuperSmootherFilter with half the period specified for the Deviation-Scaled Moving Average.
2.
The root mean square of the value derived at Step 1 is calculated.
3.
The ratio of the first value to the second value is found.
4.
The smoothing coefficient will be equal to five times the absolute value of the ratio divided by the specified length.

"UniqueThreeRiverBottom UpsideTasukiGap and the second candles are long and bullish and continue the uptrend; from the first one; ## Technical Analysis # Rising Wedge The Rising Wedge pattern resembles the Ascending Triangle : both patterns are defined by two lines drawn through peaks and bottoms, the latter headed upward."
"However, in case of the Rising Wedge, the upper line also moves up to the right and its slope is less than that of the lower trendline."
A decent Rising Wedge has at least five reversals: three for one trendline and two for the opposite.
"Both Rising and Falling Wedges show great versatility: they could appear as consolidation patterns with the trend, or against the trend, or even as topping patterns after a climax."
"Statistically, the latter are less often to occur but seem more striking than consolidation."
"When following a downtrend, the Rising Wedge pattern shows a weak rally which, in most cases, will end up breaking through the lower line, thus continuing the preceding trend."
"Upward breakouts are less common, but do happen every now and then and are more probable than downward breakouts in Falling Wedges."
"This should be especially watched out for when the Rising Wedge accompanies an uptrend: its versatile nature can make it a reversal pattern, not continuation as one might expect."
"Breakouts are generally expected in the second half of the pattern, closer to the middle."
"Rising Wedges often come after a climax peak, a dramatic reversal of an uptrend, often on heavy volume."
"In this case, price within the Rising Wedge, being a rally, usually fails to reach the climax peak value and breaks through the lower line."
"During the pattern formation, volume is most likely to fall, which is best observed when the Rising Wedge follows the market climax."
"The estimated performance of the Rising Wedge is somewhat lower than that of the falling one, with Rising Wedge that breakouts downward being one of the least reliable patterns."
Wider wedges seem to be more reliable than the narrow ones.
Rectangle Triangle ## Technical Analysis # Trendflex ## Description The Trendflex indicator is a variation of the Reflex study.
It is an oscillator that helps reveal market data cycles.
It is based on a model that regards market data as a combination of data cycles and short-term trends.
"This model is slightly different than the model used in Reflex: in Trendflex, trendlines are always horizontal, ending at the most recent peak or valley and starting above or below the previous peak or valley."
"Carefully selecting the projected cycle length and analyzing the values of the Trendflex indicator, one can identify the turning points as stipulated by this model."
The Trendflex indicator is calculated using the following algorithm: 1.
The price data is run through the EhlersSuperSmootherFilter .
2.
A presumed trend length is calculated based on the selected indicator (cycle) length.
3.
A root mean square of the average distance between the horizontal trendline and price points is found.
4.
The ratio of the average distance to its root mean square yields the Trendflex indicator value.
"When the indicator is at its maximum, a peak-to-peak trend may have come to an end."
"When the indicator is at its minimum, a valley-to-valley trend may have come to an end."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The projected data cycle length.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Trendflex ` | The Trendflex indicator plot.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

"This feature shows ... SlowRSI The Slow Relative Strength Index is a version of the classic Relative Strength Index (RSI), ... ## Technical Analysis # MovAvgAdaptive ## Description The Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is a moving average that changes its sensitivity to price moves depending on the calculated volatility."
It becomes more sensitive during periods when the price is moving smoothly in a certain direction and becomes less sensitive when the price is volatile.
"This is done by calculating the Efficiency Ratio (ER), a measure of relative trend strength."
"There are two modes of calculation of the Adaptive Moving Average, which are different in how the ER is calculated: KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average) and AMA (Adaptive Moving Average)."
"In KAMA, the ER is calculated as the ratio of directional value (the absolute value of momentum) to volatility (calculated here as the sum of absolute values of price changes on the bar-by- bar basis over a certain time period)."
"In AMA, the ER accounts for the location of the close price relative to the high-low range."
The default period for the ER calculation in either mode is 10 bars.
"Based on the ER value, the indicator selects a smoothing coefficient for the exponential moving average to be applied to the price data."
"By default, the maximum possible value of the ER (perfect trending conditions) corresponds to the smoothing coefficient of a 30-period EMA, while the minimum possible ER value (conditions of extreme volatility) corresponds to that of a 2-period EMA."
ER values in between correspond to smoothing constants derived from a quadratic equation proposed by Perry Kaufman.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price with which the Adaptive Moving Average will be calculated.
"` fast length ` | The length of the EMA that corresponds to the minimum possible Efficiency Ratio coefficent, conditions of extreme volatility."
"` slow length ` | The length of the EMA that corresponds to the maximum possible Efficiency Ratio coefficient, trending conditions of extreme strength."

Closing a Single Option Creating A Stock Order ## Technical Analysis # SimpleTrendChannelFilter ## Description The Simple Trend Channel Filter study is part of a trading system developed by James E. Rich and John B.
Rich.
"Being the first step in the system, a filter, it recognizes symbols suitable for application of the strategy ."
"Like many other study filters, it has been adapted for usage in thinkorswim Stock Hacker."
"The Simple Trend Channel trading system is an attempt to simplify trading decisions using only few well-known basic indicators, namely, three simple moving averages (SMA) with different lengths."
"Before applying the filter, a 50-period SMA needs to be calculated for S&P 500 to check whether the market is trending and if it is, to determine the trend direction."
"Since the main principle of the system is simplicity, this check is also simple: prices above the SMA are read as an indication of an uptrend, while the opposite situation is perceived as a downtrend."
"When the overall market trend direction is determined, the filter will help you recognize the stocks to apply the strategy to."
These stocks need to be moving in the same direction as the market and its up to you to decide at which trend strength they could be profitable to trade.
"The filter allows for three levels of trend strength: Min, Normal, and Max; this is controlled by the trend check input parameter."
"Basically speaking, this input defines how strict the trend check needs to be."
"Setting it to ""Min"" will only compare the close price with its 50-period SMA; ""Normal"" will add comparison of the 20-period SMA with the 50-period SMA; ""Max"" will also have the system compare the 50-period SMA with the 200-period one."
## Input Parameters ` trend check ` | Defines how strict the trend check needs to be.
---|--- ` show label ` | Defines whether or not to display a chart label that indicates the recognized trending conditions.
"## Plots ` Downtrend ` | A boolean plot that has a value of 1 for symbols that are in downtrend, based on the selected trend check mode."
"---|--- ` Uptrend ` | A boolean plot that has a value of 1 for symbols that are in uptrend, based on the selected trend check mode."

StressIndicator SVEPivots crosses above the -RMS; ## Technical Analysis # WarningSymbols ## Description The Warning Symbols study is a technical indicator developed by Barbara Star.
"Based on the well-known MACD , it focuses specifically on its trending and momentum properties."
"In Warning Symbols, MACD is analyzed in relation to the zero level, which produces important trading signals."
"In addition to MACD analysis, this indicator displays warning signals (hence the name) based on the behavior of the price plot in relation to moving averages."
"In Warning Signals, MACD is interpreted based on the following factors: its sign, direction, and divergence."
"As in many other indicators, positive MACD is regarded here as an uptrend sign and negative MACD is meant to signify the downtrend."
MACD fluctuations around the zero line often signify weak momentum in a sideways trend.
"When MACD is positive, its behavior indicates the momentum: rising values often indicate the rising momentum, while declining values might signify its ongoing depletion."
"The latter might result in a corrective pullback or even in a trend reversal, another sign for which is the divergence from the price plot."
"By default, the price plot is colored based on MACD values: when its negative, the bars are colored red, when its positive, blue."
"In addition to the MACD, the study calculates exponential and weighted moving averages of close price, which are used to issue warning signals."
"It happens when: Price reaches its high above the weighted moving average, but the trade fails to close above the exponential average; Both close price and the exponential average are greater than the weighted average."
## Input Parameters ` macd fast length ` | Defines the length for calculation of the faster average in MACD.
---|--- ` macd slow length ` | Defines the length for calculation of the slower average in MACD.
` weighted average length ` | Defines the length for calculation of the weighted moving average.

"This strategy ... above the weighted moving average, but the trade fails to close above the exponential average; ## Technical Analysis # PairTradingLong ## Description The Pair Trading Long strategy is part of Domenico D'Errico's pair trading system."
"By design, this strategy is to be used along with Pair Trading Short ."
The two strategies provide entry and exit points for both the long and short securities traded in the pair.
This requires that the second strategy be applied to the secondary symbol on a separate chart: consider either opening a detached chart window or using the chart grid.
The Pair Trading Long strategy adds long entry and exit simulated orders to the primary symbol chart based on the price ratio of that symbol to the secondary; the ratio is analyzed in reference to its fast and slow simple moving averages.
"Based on the selected trending mode of the price ratio, the simulated orders will be added once specific moving average breakout conditions are met."
Consider adding the Price Ratio study to a lower subgraph in order to determine the suitable trending mode.
Trend following mode.
"In the trend following mode, the price ratio shows a clear trend: either bullish or bearish."
Selecting this mode will have the strategy add a buy to open simulated order when the fast moving average crosses above the slow one.
A sell to close simulated order will be added once the fast average crosses below the slow one.
Mean reversion mode.
"In the mean reversion mode, the price ratio shows continuation of a preceding trend after a retracement of about 50%."
Selecting this mode will have the strategy add a buy to open simulated order when the price ratio crosses below its fast moving average.
"Conversely, a sell to close simulated order will be added when it crosses above."
Trend-and-pullback mode.
"In the trend-and-pullback mode, the price ratio shows numerous pullbacks in the main trend."
Selecting this mode will have the strategy add a buy to open simulated order when the price ratio crosses below the fast moving average while being above the slow one.
A sell to close simulated order will be added once the price ratio crosses above the fast average while being below the slow one.
## Input Parameters | ---|--- ` second symbol ` | Defines the secondary symbol for the price ratio.
This is also the symbol to apply the Pair Trading Short strategy to.
` fast length ` | Defines the length of the fast simple moving average.
` slow length ` | Defines the length of the slow simple moving average.
` mode ` | Select a suitable trending mode of the price ratio.

It is equal to the ratio of the change in close price over a period to the total sum of changes in close price recorded on the bar-by-bar basis over the same period.
"The Efficiency ratio produces values that range from 0.0 to 1.0, higher values possibly indicating stronger trending conditions."
"Its main plot is accompanied with a fixed trend level: when study values surpass this level, the study indicates that a trend might be currently developing."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period upon which the calculations of the total sum and the net change are performed.
---|--- ` level ` | Defines the minimum value level for the trend to be recognized.
## Plots ` ER ` | The main Efficiency Ratio plot.
---|--- ` TrendLevel ` | The minimum trend level.

It is calculated as the difference between a price component and its moving average with a variable length.
Cycle Trend analytics can be used in two modes: cycle and trend.
The price component is selected based on the mode.
"In the cycle mode, the price component is a sinewave with a 30-bar period."
"In the trend mode, the close price is used as the price component."
The indicator calculates 26 plots of the difference of the price component and its moving averages with lengths incrementing from 5 through 30.
Each line is shown in a progressively different color on the scale from yellow to red.
The cycle mode graph represents the response to the pure cycle over the range of moving average values.
"In the trend mode, the same is shown for real close prices: the amount of separation between the yellowest and the reddest lines represents the strength of the current trend."
"High positive values of the reddest lines signify a possible uptrend, and low negative values of the reddest lines signify a possible downtrend."
"In addition to the main lines, the indicator also shows a reference plot representing the diffference between the fastest and the slowest moving average."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` mode ` | Defines whether to output the data in the trend or the cycle mode.
"## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Price ` | The price component: a 30-bar period sinewave in the cycle mode, or close price in the trend mode."

"Time Level ## How to thinkorswim # Portfolio Margin Before you start, watch our video on Portfolio Margin!"
Portfolio Margin is a method available for certain accounts for computing required margin for stock and option positions that is based on the risk of the position rather than the fixed percentages of Regulation T and strategy based margin.
This method uses theoretical pricing models to calculate the loss of a position at different price points above and below current stock or index price.
The largest loss identified is the margin required of the position.
The result is often lower margin requirements than would be calculated from the old method.
Stock and option positions are tested with a minimum +/- 15% price changes.
Small cap broad-based indices are tested with a minimum -12% +10% price changes.
Large cap broad-based indices are tested with a minimum -12% +10% price changes.
"The range is divided into ten equidistant points, and the loss/gain on the position as a whole is calculated at each of the ten points (scenarios)."
Stress testing is done on a positions implied volatility and the margin requirement will be the largest loss calculated on any given scenario.
"Thus, hedged positions may have lower requirements than non-hedged positions."
"However, positions that are concentrated will be evaluated using a greater range and thus the requirement on these positions will be greater in comparison to a non-concentrated position."

This interface provides you with a visual representation of a symbols price over time and hundreds of technical indicators that will help you analyze the price action.
The video below will guide you through this interface and articles in this section will give you detailed descriptions of its components and useful features.
All Videos 1\.
Symbol Selector and Other Header Controls The first thing you do in Charts is specify the symbol for which the price plot will be displayed.
"To do so, type in the symbol name in the Symbol Selector box."
You can also look through all the available symbols to pick the desirable one: click on the gray triangle and search through the categories in the dialog that pops up.
"In Charts, you can view and analyze price plots of any kind of symbols: stock, options, futures, and forex."
"Note: in addition to the Symbol Selector, the header contains other useful controls, such as Clipboard, symbol description, chart sharing, Edit Studies and Strategies, Chart Settings, Quick Time Frames, Style, Drawings, Studies, and Patterns."
2\.
"Chart Time Frame Once you pick up a symbol, you will see its price plot on the main subgraph."
"By default, the 1 year 1 day time frame is used (which means that the chart displays one year worh of data, candles aggregated on a daily basis)."
"To change this time frame, lick on the Time Frame button above the chart, next to the gear button, and specify the desirable aggregation period and time interval."
You can also pick a time frame from your Favorites.
"To learn more about time frames, refer to the Chart Aggregation section."
"To learn how you can customize the list of your favorite time frames, refer to the Favorite Time Frames article."
3\.
"Chart Type and Chart Mode By default, the chart uses the Candle char type; however, you are free to change it to another chart type, e.g., Bar, Line, etc."
"To do so, click Style in the header, move your cursor over the Chart type menu item, and select the preferred chart type."
"Chart types are characteristic of the price plot in the Standard mode, however, you may choose and advanced mode, e.g., Monkey Bars or Seasonality."
More information on the chart modes and types can be found in the Chart Modes and Chart Types sections.
4\.
"Volume and Lower Subgraphs Below the main subgraph, youll find additional subgraphs."
"By default, the only visible additional subgraph is Volume , which displays the volume histogram and volume-based studies."
"When you add a study designed to be displayed on an individual subgraph (neither main, nor volume), e.g., ADX, a new subgraph will be added below the volume, such subgraphs are called Lower subgraphs."
"All subgraphs have the main area (where the price, volume, and study values are plotted), two axes (time axis and value axis), and a status string (a string above the main area, which displays important time, price, volume, and study values based on where your cursor is)."
"The parameters of the axes can be customized in the corresponding tabs (Price Axis, Time Axis) of the Chart Settings menu."
"Note: this menu controls the representation of every minor feature in Charts, so weve dedicated an entire manual section to this menu."
5\.
"Additional Controls Below the lowest subgraph, there are additional controls: Cursor type ."
This icon brings up the menu that will prompt you to select the desired cursor shape.
Right Expansion .
"This icon brings up a menu that will help you customize charts expansion area: an additional chart area that appears when required by a certain component (a study, a corporate action, or listed options to be displayed)."
Scrollbar .
"Simply enough, it lets you scroll the time axis."
A single click on either arrow will scroll your chart one candle (bar) to the left or to the right.
Zoom In / Zoom Out .
These icons help you set up the desirable scale.
Note that you can also zoom in on a specified chart area simply by selecting it with the pointer (see Active Tool below) or scrolling up while holding the Ctrl button.
You can also click Ctrl+ and Ctrl- to zoom in and zoom out.
Active Tool .
"By default, your active tool is the pointer (which enables you to zoom in on desirable areas by selecting them, activate and modify drawings, etc)."
"This control, however, lets you choose another tool, e.g., a pan, which enables you to re-position your viewing area by dragging-and-dropping, or a Drawing tool."
Drawing Set Selector .
This control will enable you to perform operations with your drawing sets .
6\.
"Chart Grid Like several other thinkorswim interfaces, Charts can be used in a grid, i.e., you can open multiple Charts instances in a single layout."
Each instance is independent from others and displayed in an individual grid cell.
To create a chart grid: 1\.
Click on the Grid button above the header.
The Grid menu will appear.
2\.
Hover your mouse across the layout editor to specify the configuration of your chart grid.
It needs to be rectangular and its maximum size depends on your screen resolution.
3\.
Click when the desirable grid is highlighted.
"For example, doing so when a 3x3 grid is highlighted will display nine chart cells."
"You can use each chart cell the same way you would use the full-size interface, however, adding too many cells will optimize the display: the volume will be overlapped to the main subgraph, lower subgraphs will be turned off, axes will be hidden, etc."
This might also affect visibility of studies and drawings.
4\.
"If you need to maximize any of the cells, i.e., view a Charts instance in full size, click its Show actions button and choose Maximize cell; alternatively, you can double-click the symbol description."
Double-clicking the symbol description again will restore the original configuration.
5\.
You can save your grid for further use.
"To do so, click on the Grid button and choose Save grid as... in the menu."
Specify the grid name and click Save .
"This will save all your charts in the grid with all studies, patterns, and drawing sets added to them."
You can manage your saved grids in the same menu.
6\.
The name of the last loaded grid is shown to the left of the Grid button.
Resetting the grid or workspace will clear this space.

Uptrend and non-trending market conditions are considered in this strategy.
"To check for trend existence, PriceZoneOscillator strategies use the Average Directional Index (ADX)."
"If the ADX indicates trending conditions, an exponential moving average (EMA) is used for defining trend direction."
"By default, the strategy employs the 14 period ADX and the 60 period EMA."
"In case the trend mode is spotted (ADX > 18), Long Exit signals are issued when: PZO values rise above the ""+60"" level and start to go down afterwards, or the price is below EMA (downtrend) and PZO is negative."
"In non-trending conditions (ADX < 18), these signals are issued when: having crossed the ""+40"" level from above, the PZO rises above the ""+60"" level and starts to go down, or having crossed the ""+40"" level from above, the PZO falls below zero while the price is below the EMA, or having crossed the ""+15"" level from below, the PZO fails to rise above ""+40"" and falls below ""-5""."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the PZO and EMA are calculated.
` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the PZO and the ADX.
` ema length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMA.

"These icons will help you utilize, configure, hide gadgets or interfaces or even link them together."
"In this article, we are going to discuss the most frequently used icons."
The Show Actions menu icon is present in almost every thinkorswim gadget and interface.
"Clicking it will bring up the Show Actions menu, which enables you to take some window-related actions, e.g., detach , print , take a screenshot, etc."
"In some interfaces, e.g., Position Summary, it will also prompt you to customize the data to be displayed there."
Detaching portions of the software into dedicated windows is a feature that is commonly used to create more elaborate layouts.
This can be useful for clients who chose to run the software on multiple monitors.
"If this is something you are interested in trying, look for the overlapping squares icon."
"Once clicked, you will see a new window appear with a copy of the section it corresponds to."
You can then move the new window to any monitor you chose.
"When a gadget or an interface is displayed in a separate window, you may want to always display it above all other windows."
"To do so, click the pin button in the top right corner of the detached window."
The gear icon allows you to configure the data you would like to view in a gadget or an interface.
Clicking it will bring up a Customize window where you will be able to configure the set of elements to be displayed.
"For example, clicking this icon in the _Position Statement_ ( Monitor tab) will prompt you to customize the set of columns in the statement."
"In _ Active Trader _ , it can be used to configure the set of buttons above the ladder."
"Note that there is also a small gear button which you will encounter in real-time data tables, e.g., watchlists or Active Trader Ladder."
"Clicking it will bring up a menu, which will prompt you to customize the column set in the table, turn of data sorting, or take some interface-specific actions."
The clip icon brings up a color-and-number selection menu; choosing a color in this menu will link the _Dashboard_ to all thinkorswim components with similar color.
"For example, consider linking a watchlist to a chart: In a watchlist symbol selector, click the clip icon and choose a color from the menu; Repeat this step in the Charts symbol selector, choosing the same color."
"Now that your watchlist is linked to the chart, clicking through the watchlist will automatically display the corresponding symbols in the Charts interface."
### Arrow icons There are several types of arrow icons in thinkorswim; heres a breakdown of what they look like and what they can be used for: Triangle arrows can be used for scrolling through a layout.
Similar arrows in table columns also indicate current sorting; clicking on it will re-sort the table.
Clicking this triangle in a symbol selector will bring up the Symbol Lookup table.
"Open-ended arrows, or ticks, can be respectively used for expanding/collapsing elements."
Click this double triangle arrow to collapse/expand all collapsible elements in the current layout.
Use this control in a Watchlist header to switch between your watchlists in a group.
"Use this control in data tables, e.g., _Trade Activity_ , to display fewer or more columns."
"A small arrow in the bottom right corner of a field indicates that the element can be customized via a drop-down list, which will be brought up once you click it."
"This kind of arrow will enable you to hide some components, e.g., _Left Sidebar_ or _Order Editor_ New thinkorswim Login Window Keyboard Shortcuts and-number selection menu; and choose a color from the menu; ## Technical Analysis # ThreePeriodDivergence ## Description The Three Period Divergence strategy is a trading system developed by Perry Kaufman, which is based upon analysis of momentum-price divergence."
"Best applied to daily price data, this strategy identifies time points where a momentum indicator (in our case, the Stochastic ) and the price move away from each other."
"Divergences occur in two directions: a bearish divergence is identified when the price rises and the momentum falls, a bullish divergence is vice versa."
"While looking for divergences is quite a popular technique to follow, it is not always obvious which timeframe should be used or even how the divergence can be determined."
"Moreover, divergence signals can often be misleading, thus confirmation of these signals is crucial."
"Three Period Divergence addresses these problems as follows: Divergence is looked for based on linear regression slopes of the momentum (either the FastK or the FastD component of the Stochastic) and the price; Momentum needs to be defined on the period from five to 40 days; Linear regression slopes for both the price and the momentum are found on three periods (Mr. Kaufman suggests that the first period be 5 days, the second period from six to 12, and the third one from seven to 15); Divergence occurs when the signs of the momentum slope and the price slope are opposite; In order to confirm the divergence, momentum slope is compared to the price slope on each of the calculation periods (the divergences must be all in the same direction)."
"Note: these periods are defined here as ranges; this is due to the fact that suitable periods differ from symbol to symbol, thus the strategy allows for optimization."
Note also that searching for the divergence on each of the three calculation periods might reduce the number of signals.
"However, changing input parameters will allow you to search where the divergence occurs on at least two (or even one) of the three periods."
"Once the divergence is identified, strategy adds simulated orders based on the dollowing rules: a buy signal is added when the bearish divergence occurs on the specified number of calculation periods out of three, and a sell signal when the bullish divergence is identified (on the same number of periods)."
Strategy will exit when all three price slopes are of the same sign as those of the momentum.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` fast momentum ` | Defines whether the momentum is calculated as the FastK component of the Stochastic (otherwise the FastD component is used).
` momentum length ` | Defines the period on which the momentum is calculated.
` dvg length1 ` | Defines the shortest of the periods for the calculation of slopes.
` dvg length2 ` | Defines the middle period for the calculation of slopes.
` dvg length3 ` | Defines the longest of the periods for the calculation of slopes.
` entry number ` | Defines the number of divergences sufficient for signal generation.
` max divergences ` | Defines on how many periods the price and the momentum need to move in the same direction for the strategy to exit.
"` long only ` | Setting this input to ""yes"" will disable all short entry and short exit simulated orders."

Using Averages The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is basically the arithmetic mean of preceding prices on a specified time period.
"Being ubiquitous in technical analysis, it is the simplest tool for trend determination."
"In thinkScript, this type of moving average can be calculated by calling function ` Average ` with the following syntax: def avg = Average(close, 9); This will calculate the Simple Moving Average of Close price over last nine bars."
"Note that just like all the other averages, SMA has a default value for period on which it should be calculated: for this type of average it is equal to 12."
"In other words, if you omitted the 9 in the script above and just typed def avg = Average (close); The 12 period SMA of Close price would be calculated."
"Compared to other averages, SMA assigns equal weight to each days price which, by some chartists, is believed not quite correct: according to them, heavier weight should be given to the more recent data."
"In order to eliminate this problem, Weighted Moving Average (WMA) was designed: this type of average artificially assigns weight to prior prices by using specific coefficient when calculating the mean value."
"To calculate the WMA, thinkScript multiplies each prior price on the specified period by weight factor equal to sequence number of its bar on the specified period and then the total sum of these values is divided by the sum of multipliers."
"Therefore, most weight is given to the current bar and least to the first one."
"Here is the syntax of ` WMA ` function: def avg = WMA(open, 10); This script will calculate the 10 period WMA of the Open price."
"If 10 is omitted, the default value of 9 will be used for the length parameter."
"While WMA corrects SMAs weighting problem, both averages share another disadvantage: their calculation suggests that the oldest value on the period be removed when passing to the following bar which means that only most recent data is taken into consideration."
These issues are addressed by Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
"Giving more weight to the more recent data, the Exponential Moving Average, however, does not completely eliminate price action prior to the calculation period."
This is possible because EMA uses a different calculation mechanism than the SMA does.
"Here is the formula: where p 1 is the price of the last bar, p 2 is the price of the previous bar, and so on, and is a smoothing coefficient calculated as follows: where N is equal to ` length ` ."
"EMA smoothing is applied to data by calling the ` ExpAverage ` function: plot avg = ExpAverage(high,9); This script will plot EMA of the High price with length equal to 9 which makes the smoothing coefficient equal to 20%."
ExpAverage has 12 as the default value for the length parameter.
Another method of assigning weights while keeping older data is Wilders Average.
Its calculation is similar to that of EMA except it uses SMA instead of the price itself as the last term in total sum of prices.
"Also, in Wilders Average, the smoothing coefficient is equal to 1/N."
"To use the Wilders Average, the following script is suggested: def avg = WildersAverage(low,20); This script will plot Wilders Average of the Low price with length equal to 20 which makes the smoothing coefficient equal to 5%."
"Just like SMA and EMA, WildersAverage has 12 as the default value for the length parameter."
"In thinkScript, there is also a generalized function which is able to return all kinds of the mentioned moving averages (and also, the Hull Moving Average ): ` MovingAverage ` ."
"However, using this function is a bit more complicated as it accepts constants as input parameters."
"Consider the following script: input length = 12; input averageType = AverageType.SIMPLE; plot MovAvg = MovingAverage(averageType, close, length); This script will plot 12 period SMA of Close price; however, once added on chart, this study will be able to change the type of average via Edit Studies and Strategies window: input average type will allow you to select Weighted, Exponential, Wilders, or Hull average instead of the Simple one."
This script is also a good example of how constants look in thinkScript: notation of a constant has two parts separated by a dot where the first part shows constants family and the second one is its name.
"For example, other constants of the AverageType family are: AverageType.EXPONENTIAL; AverageType.WEIGHTED; AverageType.WILDERS; AverageType.HULL."
The full list of constants and families they belong to can be found here .
There is also information on which functions use a certain family of constants.
In the next chapter we will discuss how to specify conditions in thinkScript.

Time for a Strategy Change?
(You'll Know it When You See It.)
"Read Its Part of the Game SOMETIMES WHEN STOCKS are moving the same way day after day and volatility is just hanging out at below-average levels, your trading may feel a bitshall we saypredictable."
But then one day things stop lining up.
Systems fail without much warning.
"Maybe its a political event, a virus outbreak, or a natural disaster."
"Stuff like this changes moods, regardless of the fundamentals, and it reminds you that volatility happens."
"Sharp, emotional reactions increase volatility (vol), which increases risk."
"As traders, we should be ready to embrace volatility and higher-risk environments."
It doesnt mean youre immune to risk.
But you should be aware of how risk can impact your positions and overall portfolio.
"When the market moves quickly and sharply, its natural to get hung up trying to figure out which positions are losing the most."
But theres more to risk than just looking at profit and loss.
"As an option trader, youre used to vol moving around a lot."
"You can see it in the greeksdelta, gamma, theta, vega (changes in direction, time, and volatility)."
Those values start changing from the time you place a trade right up until your options expire.
The magnitude of the change is related to the risk of your options.
"But instead of looking at each position independently, maybe take a step back and look at your portfolio from the perspective of overall risk, not just volatility."
"Our feature article, Well, That Wasnt Supposed to Happen!"
on page 16 highlights changing greeks and shows you how to do an apples-to-apples comparison of all your open positions.
This could help you decide if you want to reduce risks or if its okay to hold on a little longer.
"But maybe its not just about vol, time, and direction."
It can be about your strategies too.
"If youve been trading for a while, you know that your strategies work until they dont."
Time for a Strategy Change?
(Youll Know It When You See It) on page 28 points out a few reasons for this and some ideas for how to bob and weave when it happens.

Theres no right or wrong way to tackle the markets.

"IFT_StochOsc ImpVolatility ## Technical Analysis # Introduction Classic patterns are of great importance in technical analysis, specifically in trend research."
"Appearing as vast formations at the end of a trend, they might signify that this trend is going to be continued or reversed."
"However, unlike the candlestick patterns , classic patterns are rarely exclusively reversal or continuation: most of them can act as both, but statistically tend to continue or reverse the trend."
"Another difference is that candlestick patterns appear as immediate local configurations of several candles (generally, one to five) of specific shape and location while classic patterns take their time to form completely, a couple of weeks to several months in general."
Configurations of individual candles do not matter in this kind of patterns: it's all about shapes and lines and angles they make together.
A _classic pattern_ is identified when for a specified time period there are several lines whose attributes satisfy certain conditions.
"These conditions are defined based on the pattern type, but all consist of some combination of trendlines, support, and resistance: A _trendline_ is a line that runs through tops and bottoms and has a definite slope, up or down."
_Tops_ (peaks) and _bottoms_ (troughs) are local price reversal points.
_Peaks_ appear when a bearish reversal occurs and _bottoms_ appear with bullish reversals.
"_Support_ and _resistance_ lines are straight lines that run through bottoms and peaks, respectively."
"When the system detects a special configuration of trendlines, support, and resistance showing the necessary number of reversals, you will be notified that a pattern has occurred."
"While being within a classic pattern, often seen as a sideways trend, the price accumulates power to break through one of the lines."
"It can then move upward or downward, thus making the pattern to be _reversal_ or _continuation_ ."
The point where the price comes out of the pattern is called _breakout_ point.
Patterns that have resulted in a breakout are called _completed_ ; those still inside the lines are called _emerging_ .
"For completed breakouts, the system can calculate the ""predicted"" range."
This is the range the price is statistically likely to move in.
Breakout points are of great interest to chartists as they may indicate further price move.
"While in most cases patterns may be broken out of in either direction, they statistically tend to ""choose"" one."
"When the breakout happens, the price is likely to follow the direction of the breakout so the _preceding trend_ is reversed or continued."
"Having breached the line, the price may retreat back into the pattern; this is called _pattern failure_ ."
"In order to avoid a lot of failures, use the 5% rule: a breakout may be considered ""stable"" when the breakout price has risen/fallen by at least 5%."
This will not take care of all the false breakouts but may filter out most of them.

This indicator is best used when the market is in the cycle mode.
The plot of the correlation of the price with a cosine wave may help identify turning points as it forms peaks and valleys coinciding with peaks and valleys in the price.
"In addition to the cosine-based correlation plot, the study shows the negative-sine wave correlation."
This correlation can be considered rate of change since the negative sine wave is the derivative of the cosine wave.
Crossovers of this plot with the zero level may help detect the beginning and the end points of cycles.
"Note: Since this indicator is designed to be used in the cycle mode, consider pairing it with the Correlation Cycle Angle study, which can help detect trending and cycle modes."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The presumed wavelength.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` CorrelationWithCosine ` | The correlation of price with a cosine wave.

iPhone - Trading Option Spreads iPhone - Position Management ## Technical Analysis # MoneyFlowOscillator ## Description The Money Flow Oscillator (MFO) is a technical indicator developed by Vitali Apirine.
"Being an oscillator that measures buying/selling pressure over the specified time period, it extends the range of pressure indicators such as Money Flow Index (MFI) , Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) , and MACD ."
"While sharing the purpose of these indicators and some of their calculation steps, the MFO attempts to address some issues relative to them."
"More specifically, the research of the author shows that the MFO is more sensitive to gaps than the Chaikin Money Flow indicator and may react more quickly than the MACD."
"The calculation mechanism of the MFO resembles that of the Chaikin Money Flow, however, the multiplier is calculated differently: in the case of MFO, the multiplier is based on the difference between the highs and lows from the current and preceding bars."
"The oscillator values fluctuate around the zero line in the -1.0 to +1.0 range, rarely reaching extreme values."
"When the oscillator is positive, it might indicate that the buying pressure is currently prevailing, while negative values mean exactly the opposite, i.e., that selling pressure is stronger."
"The MFO is said to be more efficient in strong trends, whereas in choppy markets its reliability may be challenged."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | The period on which buying and selling pressures are measured.

"The current implementation and default values of this channel are presented by Oscar G. Cagigas in his article ""The Degree of Complexity""."
"In order to build the Donchian channel, the system registers the highest high and the lowest low price on two periods (by default, 40 and 15)."
"The upper band value is equal to the highest high on the shorter period if there is a simulated short position; otherwise, the highest high on the longer period is used."
"The lower band uses the lowest low on the shorter period if there is a simulated long position; if the position is short or absent, the lowest price on the longer period is plotted instead."
"At the lowest complexity level, the strategy adds simulated orders according to the following rules: Buy To Open ."
The high price is greater than the previously calculated highest high on the longer period.
Sell To Open .
The low price is less than the previously calculated lowest low on the longer period.
Buy To Close .
The high price is greater than the previously calculated highest high on the shorter period.
Sell To Close .
The low price is less than the previously calculated lowest low on the shorter period.
"To increase the complexity of the system to the medium level, you can add either a volatility filter or an ATR -based stop loss."
"The volatility filter affects simulated entry orders: in addition to the previously described conditions, this filter enables checking whether the previous true range was less than its average value multiplied by a factor."
"The stop-loss affects simulated exit orders: for Sells, it checks whether the close price is less than the entry price minus the Average True Range (ATR) multiplied by the stop factor."
"For Buys, it's vice versa: the high price needs to exceed the entry price by the ATR multiplied by the stop factor."
"In order to set the strategy to the medium level, set either the ` atr factor ` or the ` atr stop factor ` to a non-zero value."
"If you prefer to use the highest complexity level, make sure both parameters are non-zero."

ConsBarsUpLE ## Technical Analysis # MajorGannLevels ## Description The Major Gann Levels study is designed for Gann theory implementation based on numerical relationships between past High and Low prices and cyclical patterns in time.
"Gann theory distinguishes four major levels of support: G1, G2, G3, and G4."
"G1 is the level of 50% retracement from the all-time High, which might be indicative of future upward movement renewal."
"If that doesn't hold, look for G2 level which is the midpoint between the all-time High and all-time Low."
Renewal failure at G2 suggests looking for G3 which is 75% retracement from the all-time High.
"If all of the three levels failed to indicate support, it might occur at G4 which is calculated as a quarter of the all-time High-Low range added to the all time Low."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` G1 ` | The G1 Gann Level; 50% retracement from the all-time High to zero.
` G2 ` | The G2 Gann Level; 50% retracement from the all-time High to the all-time Low.

"In his article, ""Whiter is Brighter,"" Dr. Ehlers discusses that market data is akin to ""pink noise"" (a scientific term that refers to a type of noise where the power spectral density is stronger at lower frequencies)."
Isolating the white spectrum (whose power spectral density is the same at all frequencies) is said to output data that can be transformed into a zero-lag oscillator.
The isolation of the white spectrum data is done via a momentum-based equation.
This data is further subjected to EhlersSuperSmootherFilter so that undesirable wave components are eliminated.
The filtered data is then transformed into an oscillator by using the automatic gain control algorithm.
"As with many other oscillators, the trading strategy can be based upon the indicator's behavior in relation to the zero line."
"Normally, it is the passings from negative to positive values and vice versa that indicate trading possibilities."
"This approach is implemented in the Universal Oscillator strategy , based upon the current technical indicator."

"## Accrued Interest The interest due on a bond since the last interest payment was made, up to, but not including the settlement date."
Anyone wishing to buy the bond pays the market price of the bond plus any accrued interest.
"Conversely, anyone selling a bond will have the proceeds increased by the amount of accrued interest."
## Acquisition The 'A' in M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) is when one company buys enough stock of another company to take control of that company.
"In many take-over attempts, the buying company may offer a price for the other company's stock that is well above current market value."
The management of the company that is being bought might ask for a better stock price or try to join with a third company to counter the take-over attempt.
"## Adjusted Option An option resulting after an event such as a stock split, stock dividend, merger, or spin-off."
"An adjusted option may represent some amount other than the one hundred shares that is standard in the U.S. For example, after a 2 for 1 stock split, the adjusted option will represent 200 shares."
"For certain adjusted options, the multiplier of the option may be something other than the $100 that is standard in the U.S. ## Affidavit of Domicile A notarized affidavit executed by the legal representative of an estate reciting the residence of the decedent at the time of death."

## Assigned To have received notification of an assignment on short options by The Options Clearing Corporation through a broker.
## Assignment When the seller (writer) of an option receives an exercise notice that obligates him to sell (in the case of a call) or purchase (in the case of a put) the underlying stock at the option's strike price.
## At-The-Money (ATM) An option is at-the-money when the price of the underlying asset is at or near the options strike price.
## Automated-Exercise The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) uses this procedure to exercise in-the- money options at expiration.
Doing so protects the owner of the option from losing the intrinsic value of the option because of the owner's failure to exercise.
"Unless instructed not to do so by the owner of the option (through the owner's broker), The Options Clearing Corporation will exercise all expiring equity options that are held in client accounts if they are in-the- money by .01 or more."
TD Ameritrade will automatically exercise an option position if it is .01 or greater in-the-money at expiration unless the owner of the option instructs otherwise.
## Automated Order Entry System Some exchanges have computerized systems designed to route stock and option orders directly to the trading pit.
They are intended to speed the execution of orders.

in the summer of 2007 when we published our first issue and forever changed the way trading conversations take place.
"Weve seen a lot of change over the last 14 years, but one thing remains constant: there are always trading opportunities."
Take 2020.
"It was certainly a year to rememberthe pandemic, the social unrest, and a tumultuous U.S. presidential election."
What started out as a strong year for the markets swiftly changed when the COVID-19 reality hit.
"The markets plunged, but then quickly recovered, with the major indices hitting record highs."
Can you say volatility?
"And now, the question on traders minds: Can we expect to see volatility continue?"
Heres another certaintya new U.S. president means things will look different in the new year.
But that doesnt necessarily mean the markets will be complacent.
"Even though full-scale distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine could be around the corner, life might not return to normal for a while."
"In some cases, a new normal has emerged, permanently."
"And if we have a divided Congress, which Wall Street seems to favor, gridlock trading could be back in vogue."
"As weve always said, uncertainty equals volatility, which equals opportunity."
"And that, at least, could be good news for traders."
How can you prepare for volatility?
A good place to start is to ask yourself what lessons youve learned from 2020 and how they can help shape your trading strategies moving forward.
Take a moment and think about what hurt or helped you last year (this is good advice for any year).
Did emotions influence your trading decisions?
Did your analytical tools fail your system?
Did you have trouble managing your trades?
"This issues cover feature, New Year, New You: Hitting the Reset Button (page 16), lays out some different paths you could follow to give your trading strategies a recharge."
"Its a new year, and if you want to trade the long game, you need to adapt as conditions change."
Another long-game tactic is adding tax planning to your to-do list.
"Nope, taxes arent fun, but staying on top of them can go a long way toward easing the pain of Tax Day."
Youll find helpful tips and strategies in The Business of Running Your Trading Business on page 28.
Getting a head start on tax planning could take a lot of weight off your shoulders and free up more time to engage with the markets.
And thats a great resolution to make for the new year.
Wishing you all the best for 2021.

Option Chain Basics Creating a Single Option Order ## Technical Analysis # BBDivergenceStrat ## Description The BBDivergence strategy is a trading system developed by Markos Katsanos and described in his article Trading the Loonie.
The main idea behind this system is to act upon temporary divergences in otherwise highly correlated markets.
"The divergence is measured by the BBDivergence study , a Bollinger Bands based technical indicator."
"Being a trading system, the BBDivergence strategy uses a combination of well- known indicators and produces simulated orders of all four types: Buy to open, Sell to close, Sell Short, and Buy to cover."
"A Buy to open simulated order is added if all of the following conditions are true: The 3-day maximum divergence is above 20, but is currently falling; Both primary close price and secondary close average have been trending up during last 2 days; The correlation between the primary and the secondary close prices is above -0.4."
"A Sell to close simulated order is added if any of the following is true: The MACD crosses below its own 9-day EMA and the Stochastic is above 85; The 3-day minimum divergence is below -20 and the rate of change is below -3; The primary trade closes at the lowest level for the last 15 days, while the correlation is below -0.4."
"A Sell short simulated order is added if all of the following conditions are true: The 3-day minimum divergence is below -20, but is currently rising; Both primary close price and secondary close average have been in downtrend during last 2 days; The correlation between the primary and the secondary close prices is above 0.4."
"A Buy to cover order is added if any of the following is true: The MACD crosses below its own 9-day EMA, the Stochastic is below 85, and the secondary close is by at least 4% greater than the 15-day low; The 3-day maximum divergence is above 20 and the rate of change is above 4.5; The primary trade closes at the highest level for the last 15 days, while the correlation is below -0.4."

The main principle of this system is that the price moves in the direction of CCI.
"Woodies CCI comprises multiple plots: CCI, TCCI, CCIHist, and several constant ones."
Zero line is the main indicator of support/resistance.
"If CCI crosses this level and does not go back for at least six bars, it might indicate trend existence; CCI crossing above zero line signifies the uptrend, if it crosses below, downtrend."
Zero line is also merged with LSMA indicator which shows if the price is below or above LSMA (a moving average designed for Woodies CCI).
"Red areas of the indicator signify that the price is below LSMA; green areas, above."
"CCI Hist represents CCI values in histogram format: red columns for downtrend, green columns for uptrend; gray/yellow columns mean that the trend has not established yet (six consequent bars above or below the zero line are needed)."
"When trend is developing, CCIHist applies the colors to columns using the following algorithm: four bars after zero crossover are gray (early development), fifth is yellow (warning that trend might emerge), and starting from the sixth, columns are red or green, based on trend direction."
"TCCI abbreviation stands for ""Turbo CCI""."
"It uses calculation period shorter than CCI itself, thus it is used for pattern detection and exit points, not trend analysis."
Additional trend indicators complement the system: Sidewinder and Chop Zone.
"Sidewinder is plotted on the ""+200"" and ""-200"" levels; its values are also shown in the chart label."
"Sidewinder takes into account relationship between EMA and LSMA of price; when it turns green, price is trending (chart label state ""Trending""), yellow means that trend is developing (chart label state ""Normal""), and red indicates that trend is absent (chart label state ""Flat"")."
"Chop Zone is plotted on the ""+100"" and ""-100"" levels."
It visualizes difference between Close price and its EMA by converting its values to colors: Yellow.
Absolute value of the difference is less than or equal to ticksize value (TS).
Lime.
The difference is in the (TS; 2TS] range.
Light Green.

In the ` switch ` statement you either need to define the ` case ` with all values from the enum or use the ` default ` statement to define actions for all enums that are not defined using the ` case ` .
Note that in the latter approach you cannot use ` case ` with equal enums.
"## Example input price = close; input plot_type = {default SMA, ""Red EMA"", ""Green EMA"", WMA}; plot Avg; switch (plot_type) { case SMA: Avg = Average(price); case WMA: Avg = wma(price); default: Avg = ExpAverage(price); } Avg.SetDefaultColor( if plot_type == plot_type."
"""Red EMA"" then color.RED else if plot_type == plot_type."
"""Green EMA"" then color.GREEN else color.BLUE); This example illustrates the usage of the ` switch ` reserved word to assign different values to plots."

They are shown at the bottom of the chart.
"The color corresponds to the aggressor side: red is for sell side, and green is for buy side."
"When a volume bar is shown in two colors, it means that the volume accumulated for this bar contains both buy and sell aggressor side trades."
Zoom in onto this bar to see individual trades for both sides.
"This will also work for a single-color bar: in this case, zooming in onto it will display individual trades of the same side."
The height of each bar is proportionate to the cumulative volume of all trades this bar consists of.
You can estimate the volume for each bar using the red reference line that appears when you hover your mouse over the volume bars.
The indication of volume correspondent to this level is located on the left.
Drag and drop the red line to proportionally change the height of each volume bar.
To customize volume bars: 1\.
Right-click on a volume bar and choose Volume Settings .
This will open the Studies configuration menu with the Volume Bars tab active.

The bars are shown in equal intervals with their height being proportionate to the aggregated transaction volume.
You can select the desirable aggregation period from the dropdown to the right.
Volume .
The system shows a new volume bar after a specified volume accumulates.
You can specify the desirable cumulative volume using the combo-box on the right.
Note : A bar may accumulate more contracts than the specified value.
This happens when the size of the last trade exceeds the limit value.
"For example, if the specified volume limit is 100 and the volume bar consists of two single consecutive trades of 50 and 100 in size, the volume bar will show 150 contracts traded, not 100."
Aggregation by price .
"All trades are accumulated in a single volume bar as long as they happen at the same price level, regardless of the aggressor side."

## Sample ## Default Colors Component | Dark L&F | Light L&F ---|---|--- Area | | Bar Chart ## Technical Analysis # RegressionDivergenceStrat ## Description The Regression Divergence strategy is an intermarket correlation trading system developed by Markos Katsanos.
"It is based on Mr. Katsanos's technical indicator Regression Divergence and takes its approach even further: instead of two securities statistically analyzed by the indicator, the strategy takes into account three."
The Regression Divergence is found between the prices of the current and the secondary symbol while also analyzing the correlation between rates of changes of the current and the tertiary symbol.
This approach shows how well two symbols are correlated and how closely the current symbol follows the dynamic of the correlation.
The strategy adds simulated buy and sell orders based on the following conditions: \- Buy to open.
The regression divergence rises above the critical level (set by default to 75) and then promptly reverses its direction while the correlation between the current and the tertiary symbols is below the correlation reference level (which defaults to 0.8).
"By default, the regression divergence needs to reverse over the next three bars for the signal to be triggered."
\- Sell to open.
"The regression divergence falls below the critical level and then promptly (over the next three bars, by default) reverses its direction while the correlation between the current and the tertiary symbols is below the correlation reference level."
\- Exits (both buy and sell).
"The maximum number of bars is reached since the entry; by default, this number is set to 11."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` symbol2 ` | Defines the symbol to calculate the divergence with.
` symbol3 ` | Defines the symbol to find the ROC correlation with.
` length ` | Defines the regression length.
` roc length ` | Defines the period over which the rates of change are calculated.
` divergence length ` | Defines the period over which the divergence is calculated.
` divergence momentum length ` | Defines the time offset (in bars) for the calculation of the forecast price.
` exit length ` | The number of bars between the entry and the exit.
` lag ` | Defines the number of bars within which the divergence reversal should happen.
` divergence critical level ` | Defines the reference level of divergence between the current and the secondary symbol.
` corr3level ` | Defines the reference level of correlation between the current and the tertiary symbol.

SlowRSI The Slow Relative Strength Index is a version of the classic Relative Strength Index (RSI), ... ## Technical Analysis # SchaffTrendCycle ## Description The Schaff Trend Cycle (STC) is a technical indicator developed by Doug Schaff as an improvement on cycle oscillators and the MACD ."
The main idea behind this oscillator is to combine the benefits of trend and cycle indicators and minimize their drawbacks such as lags or false signals.
The main purpose of the STC is to identify or confirm price direction and market turning points.
"The STC is calculated as a double smoothed stochastic of the MACD, which outputs an oscillator that moves between 0 and 100."
"In trending markets, the oscillator is expected to move up if the market is in the accelerating uptrend; accelerating downtrends are supposed to push the oscillator down."
"In sideways markets, the STC indicates oversold conditions when it reverses after falling below 25; overbought conditions, when it turns down from above 75."
## Input Parameters ` fast length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the fast moving average in the MACD.
---|--- ` slow length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the slow moving average in the MACD.
` k period ` | The number of bars used to calculate the FastK component of the stochastic.
` d period ` | The number of bars used to calculate the FastD component of the stochastic.
` over bought ` | Defines the overbought level.

LinearRegrIndicator LinearRegTrendline ## Technical Analysis # MajorGannLevels ## Description The Major Gann Levels study is designed for Gann theory implementation based on numerical relationships between past High and Low prices and cyclical patterns in time.
"Gann theory distinguishes four major levels of support: G1, G2, G3, and G4."
"G1 is the level of 50% retracement from the all-time High, which might be indicative of future upward movement renewal."
"If that doesn't hold, look for G2 level which is the midpoint between the all-time High and all-time Low."
Renewal failure at G2 suggests looking for G3 which is 75% retracement from the all-time High.
"If all of the three levels failed to indicate support, it might occur at G4 which is calculated as a quarter of the all-time High-Low range added to the all time Low."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` G1 ` | The G1 Gann Level; 50% retracement from the all-time High to zero.
` G2 ` | The G2 Gann Level; 50% retracement from the all-time High to the all-time Low.
` G3 ` | The G3 Gann Level; 75% retracement from the all-time High to zero.
` G4 ` | The G4 Gann Level; 75% retracement from the all-time High to the all-time Low.

"For a bullish Butterfly, X, B, and D are bottoms of the price plot, and A and are tops."
"A bearish Butterfly pattern is recognized if: A drive to the top is followed by a downtrend segment XA, which is then followed by an up move AB."
"This move is followed by a second downtrend segment BC, then an uptrend segment CD."
XA projection is about 61.8% of AD projection.
BC projection is about 78.6% of AB projection.
"A bullish 3 Drive Fibonacci pattern is recognized if: A drive to the bottom is followed by an uptrend segment XA, which is then followed by a down move AB."

SwingIndex ## Technical Analysis # KeltnerChannels ## Description The Keltner Channels are two volatility-based lines placed above and below a moving average.
"While resembling the Bollinger Bands , Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) as an offset measure between them and a moving average instead of standard deviation (used in Bollinger Bands)."
"By default, the distance between each channel and the moving average is equal to ATR multiplied by two."
"Keltner Channels are commonly used as a trend following indicator: closing above the upper channel line is interpreted as a bullish signal, while closing below the lower channel line is considered a bearish signal."
"In the flat trend conditions, channel lines can be interpreted as the overbought and oversold levels; in these conditions, price action often forms peaks at the upper line and troughs at the lower line."
"When applying Keltner Channels, consider using momentum indicators along with them in order to evaluate how strong the trend is."
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` displace ` | The displacement of the study, in bars."
Positive values signify a backward displacement.

"Using the library tree, you can find all the existing thinkScript entities: functions, constants, reserved words, etc."
"In addition, you can find existing studies."
Clicking on any name on this list will display a description in the description box below the tree.
Double-clicking on any name will insert it into the text editor.
"Inspector, by default, shows you a virtual numpad and a dropdown that allows you to insert an existing study name in your code."
This view mode is shown when the text cursor is in whitespace.
"When the text cursor is placed inside a study or function name, Inspector displays a panel that allows you to modify input parameters of that study or strategy."
4.
"You can rename, duplicate, export, share, and delete your scripts using the right-click menu in the left-hand pane."
5.
Use Change History/Save area.
This area allows you to save your script and manage its versioning.
See details below.
"Change History Change History is a functionality that allows you to store multiple versions of a script, label some of the versions, and revert changes."
Here is how you can use it: 1.
"Every time you make changes to your script and click Save , the system stores your script version in Change History."
"To view the list of the stored versions, click on the Change History dropdown above your script."
2.
"You can view the code of each version in Change History; however, you cannot edit it."
Only the current version can be edited.
3.
"You can restore any of the versions in Change History, i.e., make it the current version that can be edited."
"To do so, select the version you would like to restore and click Restore this version ."
Note: this will erase any changes youve made in the current version.
Consider clicking Save first to store the current version.
You can also click Undo to undo restoring of a past version.
4.
Consider labeling your script versions so you will be able to tell one from another.
"To do so, select a version you would like to label and click on the label icon."
Type in the desirable label and click OK .
The label will be displayed next to this versions name on the list.
Note: you can only have up to ten labeled versions.
"In addition, you can have up to 20 unlabeled ones."
The system automatically replaces older unlabeled versions when this limit is reached.
Always label the most important versions.
5.
"To remove a label from a version, click on the Change History dropdown and navigate to Remove label ."
Click on the version with the label you would like to remove.
6.
You can save any of the versions as a new study or strategy.
"To do so, select the version you would like to save in the Change History dropdown and click Save as new script..."
Specify the name of the study or strategy and click Save.
"Note: When you add a study or strategy with a script that has multiple versions, the system will calculate it based on its current-version script."
"If you would like to calculate it based on another version, consider restoring that version as the current one or saving it under a different name."
7.
"When you edit the same script in different instances of thinkorswim, it is saved as different versions of the same script."

"You can use these orders to protect your open position: when the market price reaches a certain critical value (stop price), the trailing stop order becomes a market order to close that position."
The initial trailing stop value is set at a certain distance (offset) away from the immediate market price of the instrument.
"For trailing stop orders to buy, the initial stop is placed above the market price, thus the offset value is always positive."
"For those to sell, it is placed below, which suggests the negative offset."
"Once placed, the stop value is constantly adjusted based on changes in the market price."
"Trailing stop orders to buy lower the stop value as the market price falls, but keep it unchanged when the market price rises."
"For trailing stop orders to sell, it's vice versa: the stop value follows the market price when it rises, but remains unchanged when it falls."
Example Let's say you bought a stock at $25 per share and would like to protect it with a trailing stop.
You place a trailing stop order to sell with an offset of $2 which means that the initial trailing stop value is $23.
"Should the market price rise to, for example, $35, the trailing stop will be adjusted (kept $2 away from the market price, so, in our case it will be equal to $33)."
"But if having reached that level, the market price starts falling, the trailing stop will keep its value of $33."
"Given that market price continues to fall and reaches this value, the trailing stop order becomes a market order with the sell price $33."

## It is safe to use thinkorswim Sharing?
"In designing the thinkorswim sharing system, we were very aware of the security concerns some users may have so we took several steps to ensure your data is protected."
"The technology for sharing has been built into thinkorswim since early 2013; we have performed an internal security review and all of the data required to create the Sharing links is handled by our technology via our secure backend servers, not on your local computer or the public Internet."
Only data that is validly shared from inside the thinkorswim application can be communicated via the sharing links themselves.
"When a user clicks on a Shared link, the only information that is passed from the browser to the thinkorswim application is the sharing link pointer; all other data is delivered by our secure servers directly to the thinkorswim application."
This ensures only valid data is retrieved and shared.
"Your account and other personal information is not shared, but if you have a public MyTrade profile then that public display name is used."
"_myTrade is a service of myTrade, Inc., a separate but affiliated firm."
"TD Ameritrade is not responsible for the services of myTrade, or content shared through the service."

CustomColor IDataHolder ## Technical Analysis # ATRHighSMABreakoutsLE ## Description The ATRHighSMABreakoutsLE is a long entry strategy developed by Ken Calhoun.
"As it is discussed in his article ATR Breakout Entries, this strategy is to be applied to stock symbols that satisfy certain price range and volume criteria; to find these symbols, use the ATRHighSMABreakoutsFilter study in the Stock Hacker."
"Akin to Mr. Calhouns previous installment, ADXBreakouts , this strategy explores high-volatility price breakouts in order to produce important long entry signals."
"In ATRHighSMABreakouts, breakout calculations are based on two popular technical indicators: the Average True Range (ATR) and a simple moving average (SMA) of the close price."
The rationale of ATR employment here is the observation that its values increase as the daily high-low ranges expand.
"For a buy signal, this will need to be confirmed by a moving average crossover."
The primary triggering condition for the long entry signal is ATR being at its 14-day highest and price being above its 100-day SMA (both numbers are customizable via input parameters).
"If this condition is fulfilled, the strategy records the high price and adds a simulated long entry order as soon as price exceeds this value by a certain amount."
This amount is set by default to 50 cents.
There are also two extra conditions which may be applied in order to refine the signals: a wide-range candle and volume increase (both turned off by default).
Turning on the wide-range candle filter will have the strategy add a simulated order only if the height of the candle at which the primary condition has triggered is at least 1.5 times greater than the average.
Turning on the volume filter will add checking if the volume has increased since the last candle.
"Since the strategy is long entry only, you might want to use other strategies for exits, e.g., TrailingStopLX ."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period for ATR calculation.
---|--- ` average length ` | Defines the period for SMA calculation.
` offset ` | Defines the minimum amount by which the price should exceed its recorded highest value.
` wide range candle ` | Defines whether the condition should only trigger at a candle whose height is at least 1.5 times greater than the average.
` volume increase ` | Defines whether the condition should only trigger if the volume has increased since the last candle.

"If either the bid or the ask price is up, a green bar is added."
"If either the bid or the ask price is down, a red bar is added."
"If the bid price is up and the ask price is down, the top half of the bar is red and the bottom half is green."
"If the bid price is down and the ask price is up, the top half of the bar is green, and the bottom half is red."
"If both the bid and ask prices are up, a bright green bar is added."

Price Axis Settings Favorite Time Frames ## Technical Analysis # MovingAvgCrossover ## Description Moving Average Crossover is a study which helps you find crossovers of moving averages of different types and lengths.
"The following moving averages can be used: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
The general idea of moving average-based analysis is combining two moving averages with different lengths: short and long.
"It is considered a Buy signal when the short average crosses above the long one; Sell signal, if the long average surpasses the short one."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used in calculation.
` length1 ` | The number of bars used in calculation of the first moving average.
` length2 ` | The number of bars used in calculation of the second moving average.
"` average type1 ` | The type of the first moving average: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

The difference of this function from ` StDev ` is that the output result for the last bar is used for the whole interval calculated.
"If the ` length ` parameter is not specified, the function is calculated for the entire plot."
The ` startDate ` (specified in the YYYYMMDD format) and ` startTime ` (specified in the HHMM format) define the date and time for the starting point of linear regression.
These parameters override any value of the ` length ` if ` startDate ` is non-zero.
"By default, the function will return ` Double.NaN ` at any moment in time outside the interval used for calculation of linear regression."
This behavior can be changed by using non-zero values of ` extendToLeft ` and ` extendToRight ` parameters.
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | Defines the variable for which the standard deviation is calculated.
"length | all chart | If specified, defines number of the last bars for which the curve is plotted, otherwise, the curve is plotted for the whole chart."
"startDate | 0 | If specified, defines the date of starting point for calculation of standard deviation, in the YYYYMMDD format."
"startTime | 0 | If specified, defines the time of starting point for calculation of standard deviation, in the YYYYMMDD format."
extendToLeft | No | Defines whether or not to extend the standard deviation curve to the left of the end point.
extendToRight | No | Defines whether or not to extend the standard deviation curve to the right of the end point.
"## Example input price = close; def regression = InertiaAll(price, 30); def stdDeviation = StDevAll(price, 30); plot UpperLine = regression + stdDeviation; plot LowerLine = regression - stdDeviation; The example draws the Standard Deviation Channel, which is the linear regression channel spaced by standard deviation."
The deviation channel is based on ` price ` data for the last 30 bars.

You can use both Aggregation Period constants and pre-defined string values (e.g.
"` Day ` , ` 2 Days ` , ` Week ` , ` Month ` , etc.)"
as valid parameters for the aggregation period.
The full list of the pre-defined string values can be found in the Referencing Secondary Aggregation article.
"Valid parameters for the price type are: ` LAST ` , ` ASK ` , ` BID ` , and ` MARK ` ."
"Note that for non-Forex symbols, the last three are only supported on intraday charts with time interval not greater than 15 days."
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- fundamentalType | \- | Defines fundamental value to be returned.
This parameter accepts Fundamental Type constants.

"Once all the irregularities are smoothed out, the study plot is a zigzag line showing generalized uptrend and downtrend segments of the price action."
"Visualization of this study includes chart label, chart bubbles, and plot coloring."
"Before the price change accumulates the specified percentage, trend state is defined as ""Unconfirmed"", which results in chart label showing this state with percentage accumulated, and study plot is colored orange."
"After a significant rise or fall, the plot is colored green (for ""Uptrend"") or red (for ""Downtrend""), each state is indicated with the chart label."
Each swing point (and the last bar on chart) is accompanied with chart bubble showing the percentage change relative to the prior swing point.
Note that the last segment of the plot can change its direction drastically as a considerable future market move might occur.
Consider using EnableApproximation function when referencing this study as only non-filtered swing points are plotted.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used to calculate swing points.

The RSI is an oscillator comparing the magnitude of a stock's recent gains to the magnitude of its recent losses on a scale from 0 to 100.
Buy and Sell signals occur upon crossovers of RSI values with oversold and overbought levels.
The strategy adds a simulated Buy order when the RSI crosses above the oversold level and a simulated Sell order when it crosses below the overbought level.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | Defines price used in calculations.
` length ` | Defines the number of bars used in calculation of RSI.
` over bought ` | Defines the overbought level.
` over sold ` | Defines the oversold level.

"## Example script MyEMA { input data = close; input length = 12; def EMA = compoundValue(1, 2 / (length + 1) data + (length - 1) / (length + 1) EMA[1], Average(data, length)); plot MyEma = EMA; } declare lower; plot Osc = MyEMA(close, 25) - MyEMA(close, 50); This code defines the MyEma script where the first EMA value is calculated as SMA in contrast to the ` ExpAverage ` function whose first value is assigned the closing price."
The main section of the code creates an oscillator based on the MyEMA difference for different lengths.
"reference switch script <script_name> { <script_code>; input data = close; input length = 12; def EMA = compoundValue(1, 2 / (length + 1) * data + (length - 1) / (length + 1) * EMA[1], Average(data, length)); plot MyEma = EMA; declare lower; plot Osc = MyEMA(close, 25) - MyEMA(close, 50); ## Technical Analysis # LinDev ` LinDev ( IDataHolder data, int length); ` Default values: ` length: 12 ` ## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | Defines the variable for which the standard deviation is calculated."
length | 12 | Defines the period on which the standard deviation is calculated.
## Description Returns the linear deviation of ` data ` for the last ` length ` bars.
## General Information Linear deviation measures the average absolute difference between the mean and the current value.
"## Example declare lower; input length = 10; plot LinearDev = LinDev(close, length); The code draws the linear deviation plot for the current symbol for the defined number of bars."
"## Example 2 script LinDevTS { input data = close; input length = 12; def avgData = Average(data, length); plot LinDevTS = ( fold i = 0 to length with LD do LD + AbsValue(avgData - GetValue(data, i)) ) / length; } declare lower; input length = 12; plot LinDev1 = LinDev(close, length); plot LinDev2 = LinDevTS(close, length); In the example above, two plots are calculated, both showing the linear deviation of the close price over the last 12 bars."
LinDev1 is calculated using the built-in function LinDev.
LinDev2 is calculated using a thinkScript implementation of this function.
Both plots form a single line on the chart.
"InertiaAll StDev declare lower; input length = 10; plot LinearDev = LinDev(close, length); input data = close; input length = 12; def avgData = Average(data, length); plot LinDevTS = ( fold i = 0 to length with LD do LD + AbsValue(avgData - GetValue(data, i)) ) / length; declare lower; input length = 12; plot LinDev1 = LinDev(close, length); plot LinDev2 = LinDevTS(close, length); 2 ## Technical Analysis # Double This section describes mathematical constants such as exponent or pi."

"Nowadays, we are able to create complex technical indicators and strategies using data one could not even imagine back in the time."
Users of thinkorswim platform are provided with a powerful and flexible tool called thinkScript language.
This embedded programming language allows you to add your own studies and strategies to more than 300 built-in ones (or even reference their values in your own scripts).
What you are going to read here is a set of tutorials which will get you acquainted with this powerful tool.
"These tutorials are not going to teach you how to trade, moreover, we presume that you already know how the charts are constructed and what, for example, the High, Low, Open and Close values are."
"The purpose of these tutorials is to describe the most useful tools of thinkScript, should it be variables, functions, or plots all of those will help you construct your perfect technical indicators."
"To start scripting, you will need to open the Editor window: this is where you type your script which is checked and parsed by the application and, if everything is correct (we are sure it will be if you read these tutorials), added to chart as a study or strategy."
In order to open the Editor: 1\.
Go to the Charts tab.
2\.
Click Studies in the upper right corner of the page.
3\.
Select Edit Studies .
The Edit Studies and Strategies window will open.
4\.
Click Create... below the list of studies.
"This will open the Editor window with pre-defined script: plot Data = close; As one can figure out, this will plot the Close price for the specified symbol."
Move on to chapter 2 where you will learn how to define variables and plot simple values like this one.
Basic plot Data = close; ## Technical Analysis # DownsideTasukiGap ## Description Downside Tasuki Gap is a bearish trend continuation candlestick pattern consisting of three candles.
The Downside Tasuki Gap candlestick pattern is recognized if: The first two candles are bearish and continue the downtrend; The second candle gaps down from the first one; The third candle is bullish and opens within the previous candle's body; The third candle's Close price is within the gap between the first and the second candles.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` trend setup ` | The number of preceding bars to check if the trend exists.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Bearish ` | The Downside Tasuki Gap candlestick pattern.
"DownsideGapThreeMethods EveningDojiStar and continue the downtrend; from the first one; is bullish and opens within the previous candle's body; ## Technical Analysis # StochasticMomentumIndex ## Description The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) is similar to Stochastic Oscillator with the difference that it finds position of the Close price relative to the High- Low range's midpoint, not the range itself."
This difference results in the oscillator being plotted on the -100 to +100 scale.
"It is considered a Buy signal when the SMI crosses above the oversold (-40) level; Sell signal, when it crosses below the overbought (+40) level."
The primary plot is accompanied with its Exponential Moving Average so that additional signals are produced.
"Crossing above the EMA suggests the Buy signal; crossing below, Sell signal."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` over bought ` | The overbought level.
` over sold ` | The oversold level.
` percent d length ` | The number of bars used to smooth the SMI.
` percent k length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the SMI.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` SMI ` | The Stochastic Momentum Index plot.
` AvgSMI ` | The EMA of the Stochastic Momentum Index plot.
` overbought ` | The overbought level.
` oversold ` | The oversold level.

BLUE CYAN ## How to thinkorswim # Study Filters The Stock Hacker Scanning Tool allows you to search for symbols meeting certain criteria.
Study filters are criteria based on study values: adding one or several study filters will help you narrow the search range when looking for symbols.
You can use up to 25 filters to scan the market.
## How to Find It: 1\.
Click the Scan tab and choose Stock Hacker from the sub-tab row.
2\.
"In the condition group you would like to add a study filter to, click on the Add filter dropdown."
Choose Study .
A new study filter editor will appear.
3\.
The first field of the editor allows you to choose a custom or pre-defined study to filter the results.
Choose the desirable study and adjust input parameters.
Note that you can set a custom aggregation period by clicking on the Aggregation Period button.
"For intraday aggregations, you can choose whether or not to include the Extended-Hours Trading session: use the EXT checkbox for that."
4\.
Click Scan .
Search results will be shown in the watchlist form below the Filters section.
5\.
"If pre-defined study filters are not enough for your scan, you can create custom study filters."
"To do so, choose Custom from the study list."
This will open the Scanner Custom Filter editor window.
"In Scanner Custom Filter, you can either use Condition Wizard , an interface that is operated by human-readable expressions, or thinkScript Editor, an interface for creation of thinkScript-based studies."
"## Example Consider the following script: close > expaverage(close, 60) and ADX(length = 14) > 18 This condition is used in the Volume Zone Oscillator study; it checks whether the price is above the 60 period EMA and 14 period ADX value is higher than 18, which could possibly mean that the market is in strong uptrend."
Click OK save the filter and then press Scan to display all symbols meeting this criterion.
"You can also use plot values in Study Filters: def SMA = Average(close, 15); plot condition = close[2] > SMA[2] and close[1] < SMA[1] and close < SMA; This example script searches for symbols which were above simple moving average two days ago, but have fallen below since then."
"Note that search criteria can be adjusted by pressing the ""pencil"" icon in the filter."
"To delete a filter, click X."
"Note also that search results are displayed in the watchlist form, which means that you can display custom quotes along with standard values."
"For more information on that, refer to the Custom Quotes article."
"## Specific Usage When in Stock Hacker, thinkScript usage is somewhat different from that in studies and strategies."
Here is the list of peculiarities: Secondary aggregation is not allowed.
Scripts using standard thinkScript syntax must have exactly one plot.
"For forex, only price type _last_ can be used."
"The ""Start aggregations at market open"" setting is disabled when the Extended-Hours Trading session is off."
## Data Limitations Data used in study filters is limited in terms of time period.
"These limitations depend on the aggregation period: Aggregation period | Data limit ---|--- 1 to 30 min | 15 astronomical days 1 to 4 hours | 270 astronomical days 1 to 4 days | 4 years Week | 6 years Month, Option Expiration | 20 years Sizzle Index You may also like Condition Wizard Condition Wizard is a special feature which allows you to build up conditions or logical ...

## How to thinkorswim # Tick Counter Tick Counter is a feature available for charts using Tick aggregation .
"This feature shows dynamic tick information for the last bar on chart, which includes the number of ticks since the open and the number of ticks until completion."
"Once the specified number of ticks has been aggregated, the counter resets to zero and starts counting ticks for the newly created bar."
You can display either of these numbers or both of them.
"In order to enable and customize Tick Counter, choose Settings from the Style menu and select the display mode from the Counter drop-down list on the Time axis tab."
Note that this list is only available on tick charts.
"In order to display the number of ticks since the open, choose Count up , to display the number until completion, Count down ; to display both of these numbers, choose Detailed ."
"To hide the Tick Counter, choose Off ."
You can also specify location of the counter: on top or at the bottom of the chart; this can be done via Counter location drop-down.

## Enterprise Value Often referred to as the theoretical takeover price of a company because it includes a companys debt.
"It is calculated by its market cap plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents."
"## Equity Equity can have several meanings, including 1) stock, as it represents ownership in a corporation, or 2) in a margin account, equity represents a client's ownership in his account; it is the amount the trader would keep after all his positions have been closed and all margin loans paid off."
## Equity Options See Stock options.
## European-Style Options An option contract that can only be exercised upon its expiration date.
Compare to American-style options.
## Excess Equity The value of cash or securities held in a margin account that exceeds the federal requirement.
## Exchange An association of persons (members) who participate in buying and selling securities.
It also refers to the physical location where the buying and selling takes place.
## Exchange-Listed Security Securities that have met certain requirements and have been admitted for full trading privileges on an exchange such as the NYSE or NASDAQ.
## Ex-Dividend Describes a stock whose buyer does not receive the most recently declared dividend.
"Dividends are payable only to shareholders recorded on the books of the company as of a specific date of record (the ""record date"")."
"If you buy the stock any time after the record date for a particular dividend, you won't receive that dividend."
## Ex-Dividend Date The day on and after which the buyer of a stock does not receive a particular dividend.
"This date is sometimes referred to simply as the ""ex-date,"" and can apply to other situations beyond cash dividends, such as stock splits and stock dividends."
"On the ex-dividend date, the opening price for the stock will have been reduced by the amount of the dividend, but may open at any price due to market forces."
## Execution The actual completion of an order to buy or sell stock or options.
"## Exercise If the buyer of a stock option wants to buy (in the case of a call) or sell (in the case of a put) the underlying stock at the strike price or, in the case of a cash-settled option, to receive the index price and the strike price settlement amount, the option must be exercised."
"To exercise an option, a person who is long an option must give his broker instructions to exercise a particular option (or if the option is .01 in-the-money at expiration it will be automatically exercised for a client) Someone with short option positions must be aware of the possibility of being assigned at any time up until the option expires, regardless of the in-the-money amount (American Style Option), or on expiration day, (European Option) the client must make sure he has adequate buying power or positions available in his account to cover any such potential assignment."
## Exercise Price (Strike Price) The cost per share at which the holder of an option may buy or sell the underlying security.
"## Expiration (Expiration Date) On the expiration date, an option and the right to exercise it cease to exist."
Every option contract becomes null and void after its expiration date.
"For standard stock options, this date is the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month."
## Expiration Cycle The expiration cycle has to do with the dates on which options on a particular underlying security expire.
"A stock option, other than LEAPS, will be in one of three cycles, the January cycle (with options listed in January, April, July or October), the February cycle (with options listed in the February, May, August or November) or the March cycle (with options listed in March, June, September or December)."
"At any given time, an option will have contracts with four expiration dates outstanding."
## Extrinsic Value (Time Value) The difference between the entire price of an option and its intrinsic value.
"For example, if a call option with a strike price of $50 has a price of $2.75, with the stock price at $52, the extrinsic value is $.75."
The price of an out- of-the-money (OTM) option is made up entirely of extrinsic value.
"## Technical Analysis # FW_SOAP ## Description SOAP (Served On a Platter, Stochastic crossover counter) is a study using a unique concept of putting two stochastic studies together."
It removes the SD moving average of both studies in order to get two SK studies crossing each other.
The second crossover above 50% indicates the SOAP sell signal with arrows.
"Similarly, the second crossover below 50% indicates the SOAP buy signal."
This works for all time periods and tick charts.
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` arrow location ` | ""Inside Lines"" and ""Outside Lines"" define arrow location on the ""S8x5"" plot, where the first value shifts arrows inside, and the second one places arrows exactly on the plot."

How does my margin account work?
"Generally, a client pledges the securities in their account as collateral for a loan that they may then use to purchase additional securities."
The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) sets margin requirements for various marginable securities.
"For instance, the current margin requirement for initial purchase of eligible securities is 50% of the purchase amount."
This is commonly referred to as the Regulation T (Reg T) requirement.
"Under Reg T, you must have at least 50% of the value of the trade in your account in either cash or fully paid marginable securities by settlement date of the trade."
"Although, The Federal Reserve determines which stocks can be used as collateral for margin loans, TD Ameritrade is not obligated to extend margin on all approved stocks."
"As an example, a client with $10,000 of cash in a margin account would be able to purchase up to $20,000 worth of marginable securities, this is known as a clients Stock Buying Power."
_Margin trading increases risk of loss and includes the possibility of a forced sale if account equity drops below required levels.
Margin is not available in all account types.
Margin trading privileges subject to TD Ameritrade review and approval.

"Like in all Thermo Mode specific studies, shorter lookback periods reflect recent changes, middle range periods are used for confirmation, and the longest ones signify possibility of continuation."
"In order to extract solely the short-term wave components, Swami Swing Wave employs digital signal processing techniques."
"In default color scheme, wave peaks are indicated by orange areas against blue background, and troughs are displayed by flashes of blue."
"Basic rule about using this indicator: avoid buying when the trough is detected in downtrend and, conversely, avoid selling in the uptrend when the peak has emerged."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used in calculations.
` length ` | The number of bars used in calculations.

SwamiRelativePerformance SwamiVolatility is a technical indicator designed for Thermo Mode; ## Technical Analysis # EhlersDecyclerOscillator ## Description The Ehlers Decycler Oscillator is a technical indicator proposed by John F. Ehlers.
Its calculation involves eliminating very low-frequency components from Ehlers Simple Decycler and transforming the output into the oscillator.
Low-frequency components are eliminated using the half-period Ehlers Highpass filter .
"The oscillator itself is equal to the ratio of the high-pass output data to price, multiplied by a coefficient."
"This coefficient is equal to 1 by default, however, you might want to adjust it if you use several instances of the oscillator on the same subgraph."
Crossovers of oscillators with different coefficients might help identifying important trend reversals.
## Input Parameters ` price ` | Defines the price on which the calculations are performed.
---|--- ` roof cutoff length ` | Defines the maximum cycle length in bars.

SlowVSI Spearman ## Technical Analysis # RateOfChangeWithBandsStrat ## Description The Rate Of Change With Bands (ROCWB) strategy is based on the eponymous technical indicator developed by Vitali Apirine.
This strategy acts on the combination of two factors: current trend and overbought/oversold conditions.
The strategy attempts to detect uptrend by comparing the current price to an exponential moving average (EMA) ; overbought/oversold levels are detected based on the crossovers of the average rate of change with ROCWB bands.
The strategy adds simulated orders based on the following conditions: Buy to open.
A simulated order of this type is added when an uptrend is detected and the average ROC crosses above the lower band.
Sell to close.
A simulated order of this type is added either when the average ROC crosses below the upper band while in uptrend or when the price crosses below EMA.
Sell to open.
A simulated order of this type is added when the average ROC crosses below the upper band while in downtrend.
Buy to close.
A simulated order of this type is added either when the average ROC crosses above the lower band while in downtrend or when the price crosses above EMA.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The type of price to be used in calculations.
` roc length ` | The length to calculate the rate of change with.
` average length ` | The length to calculate the moving average with.
` rms length ` | The length to calculate root mean square with.

IDataHolder String ## Technical Analysis # MovAvgExponential ## Description The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that assigns greater weight to the most recent price data.
"Unlike the simple moving average where all data points have the same weight, the EMA's weighting factors to price data decrease exponentially."
The recursive representation of the EMA formula is the following: ` EMA 1 = price 1 ; ` ` EMA 2 = price 2 + (1 - )EMA 1 ; ` ` EMA 3 = price 3 + (1 - )EMA 2 ; ` ` EMA N = price N + (1 - )EMA N-1 ; ` where: ` N ` is the bar number; is a smoothing coefficient equal to ` 2/(length + 1) ` .
"Calculation of an ` N ` -period EMA will normally include more than ` N ` bars worth of data; in fact, these bars will normally be assigned about 86% of weight."
The main plot of the exponential moving average can also be accompanied with breakout signals: crossovers of the price plot with the average.
Bullish breakouts are indicated every time the price crosses above the average.
"When the price falls below the average, a bearish breakout is recognized."
"By default, breakout signals are disabled; to enable them, set the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value to ` yes ` ."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price with which the EMA is to be calculated.
` length ` | The number of bars which affect the EMA most significantly.
"` displace ` | The displacement of the EMA study, in bars."
Positive values signify backward displacement.

"Three peaks need to belong to the upper line, hence the pattern name."
This describes perfect conditions; in reality it's only required for peaks to be about the same height.
"In fact, when the last peak fails to reach the middle peak's value, the trend might be getting exhausted, thus a stronger decline can be expected."
Triple Top is commonly regarded as a bearish reversal pattern.
"Stronger reversals tend to happen to stronger trends: the decline will be the greater, the greater was the rise that led to the pattern."
Preceding trend intensity is also important: a Triple Top emerging after an intensive uptrend might be expected to result in a steep decline.
"Volume trends down throughout the formation more often than not, but rising volume observed every now and then seems to be more favorable."
"In addition, pullbacks happen quite often, which deteriorates pattern performance."

"Based upon the most common technical indicators, such as simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) moving averages, it is best suitable for volatile, high-volume stocks and ETFs that show smooth, regular swing and/or trend moves."
The main principle of the strategy suggests that the entries be taken when their direction is aligned with the trend.
"In this particular strategy, the trend is determined by the 50 period EMA of the Close price (customizable via strategy input parameters)."
"The strategy also calculates two simple moving averages: SMA of High price and that of the Low price, to be used as signal lines."
"Once all the three averages are calculated, the strategy will add simulated orders upon the following conditions: A Long Entry order is added when price exceeds the SMA of High price by the specified number of ticks (5 by default) and the previous bar has closed above the EMA; A Long Exit order is added when the Low price fails to exceed its SMA; A Short Entry condition is inverse of the Long Entry one: it is added when price falls below the SMA of Low price minus the specified number of ticks and the previous bar has closed below the EMA; A Short Exit order is added when the High price goes above its SMA."

Placing Futures Trades Placing Option Trades: Calendars ## Technical Analysis # Stiffness ## Description Stiffness is a technical indicator introduced by Markos Katsanos.
"This indicator helps assess the stiffness (i.e., the quality) of an uptrend."
"Based on the observation that in strong long-lasting uptrends, price seldom penetrates the 100-bar simple moving average, this indicator might help estimate how strong the current trend is by calculating the stiffness coefficient."
The stiffness coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the number of times the price has closed above the moving average during the indicator period to the length of that period in bars.
"In order to make the calculation more flexible and eliminate minor movements, a volatility threshold is taken into account."
"If the price closes above the moving average but the distance between the average and the close price is less than a specified fraction of standard deviation, the bar is disregarded when calculating the stiffness coefficient."
"By default, the stiffness coefficient is to be at least 90 for the uptrend to be considered strong by this indicator."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to be used in the calculation of the Stiffness indicator.
` length ` | The period to be analyzed by the Stiffness indicator.
` average length ` | The length of the simple moving average.
"` num dev ` | The volatility threshold, measured in standard deviations."
The price is only considered to be above the moving average if it is greater than the average by this value.
` stiffness level ` | The minimum value of the Stiffness indicator for the uptrend to be considered strong.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Stiffness ` | The Stiffness coefficient histogram.

"The channel that develops in the Flag is relatively small, thus price action in it is almost immediate compared to other patterns: it usually takes several days to couple weeks for the Flag to be completed."
"Breakouts happen in both directions but virtually all Flags are continuation patterns, which means that Flags in uptrend are expected to break out upward and those in downtrend, downward."
Flag performance strongly depends on the initial price change as defined by the flag pole: those with price change more than 90% show a strong directional trend.
Volume is usually heavy at the pole but declines throughout the formation.
"Falling Wedge Head and Shoulders ## Technical Analysis # OnsetTrendDetector ## Description The Onset Trend Detector study is a trend analyzing technical indicator developed by John F. Ehlers, based on a non-linear quotient transform."
"Two of Mr. Ehlers' previous studies, the Super Smoother Filter and the Roofing Filter , were used and expanded to create this new complex technical indicator."
"Being a trend-following analysis technique, its main purpose is to address the problem of lag that is common among moving average type indicators."
"The Onset Trend Detector first applies the EhlersRoofingFilter to the input data in order to eliminate cyclic components with periods longer than, for example, 100 bars (default value, customizable via input parameters) as those are considered spectral dilation."
Filtered data is then subjected to re- filtering by the Super Smoother Filter so that the noise (cyclic components with low length) is reduced to minimum.
The period of 10 bars is a default maximum value for a wave cycle to be considered noise; it can be customized via input parameters as well.
"Once the data is cleared of both noise and spectral dilation, the filter processes it with the automatic gain control algorithm which is widely used in digital signal processing."
This algorithm registers the most recent peak value and normalizes it; the normalized value slowly decays until the next peak swing.
The ratio of previously filtered value to the corresponding peak value is then quotiently transformed to provide the resulting oscillator.
The quotient transform is controlled by the K coefficient: its allowed values are in the range from -1 to +1.
"K values close to 1 leave the ratio almost untouched, those close to -1 will translate it to around the additive inverse, and those close to zero will collapse small values of the ratio while keeping the higher values high."
"Indicator values around 1 signify uptrend and those around -1, downtrend."
## Input Parameters ` price ` | Defines the price to which the oscillator is applied.
---|--- ` cutoff length ` | Defines the minimum cycle length in bars.
Cycles with lesser lengths will be considered noise and eliminated.

"Study ... to be considered noise; and normalizes it; ## Technical Analysis # StochasticFast ## Description The Stochastic Fast study is a momentum oscillator based on the observation that in an uptrending market, prices tend to close near the upper end of the price range."
"In downtrends, close prices are often seen approach the lower end."
The oscillator is made up of two lines bound in the range from 0 to 100.
"By default, the FastK is the ratio of the difference between the current close and the lowest low on a period to the difference between the highest and the lowest prices on the same period."
"Basically, this formula positions the closing price in the total price range for this period, on a percentage basis."
Applying a moving average to the FastK produces the FastD line.
Crossovers of either line with overbought/oversold levels may provide important signals.
Actual indication of the crossovers can be enabled by adjusting the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value.

"The strategy adds a buy to ... ## How to thinkorswim # Setting up Chart Time Frame In general, setting up a time frame for your chart involves two things: defining a time interval, which is a time range for which the entire chart is plotted, and specifying an aggregation period, i.e., a period during which price data is accumulated for one bar (or candle, line segment, etc.)."
"The latter can be expressed in time units , ticks , or price range accumulation ."
"The Charts interface provides you with a number of standard time frames, however, you are free to create your own."
"If you switch often between time frames, consider adding the most frequently used to your favorites so they are always at hand."
To set up a time frame: 1\.
"Click on the Time Frame button above the chart, next to the gear button."
The Time Frame Setup menu will appear.
"To access this menu, you can also click the Style button and then select Time Frame Setup or just press _Ctrl+T_ on your keyboard _._ 2\."
"Click on the Time frame tab and select the Aggregation type you prefer to use: Time , Tick , or Range ."
3\.
"If your choice is Time aggregation, specify which kind of time aggregation you wish to set: standard intraday (each bar is completed in less than 12 hours), standard daily (each bar takes at least 1 day to be completed), or custom (you can specify both intraday and daily periods there)."
4\.
Specify the desirable time interval.
"For intraday aggregations, it cannot be more than 360 days, for tick aggregations - not more than 5 days."
"Abbreviations: WTD stands for ""week to date"", YTD is ""year to date"", and Max available means that the chart will load all the available price data for the symbol (note: there are symbols that can be charted all the way back to 1902)."
5\.
"If you've selected the custom time aggregation, you can specify a certain time period in the past (if there is available price data for that period) or a number of years/months/days up to today."
"Specifying the latter will display all the available chart data for the period and when the current day is over, the chart will keep updating and the left-hand chart limit will be pushed forward one day."
"Please note the difference between the From-To and Up to today controls: should you select the current date in the To box in the former control, the chart will stop updating at midnight CST (Central Standard Time)."
6\.
Specify the aggregation period.
"You can choose a pre-defined value from the list, type in a value in the combo box (for time aggregations, the format is hh:mm), or drag the slider so it displays the desirable amount of time/ticks/range units."
"On the list, Opt Exp means that the period between two consecutive expiration Fridays is taken to aggregate data for one bar."
7\.
"If you wish to add your aggregation to Favorites , click on the star icon in the bottom left corner of the dialog window."

## Leaps An acronym for Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities.
LEAPS are call or put options with expiration dates set as far as two years into the future.
"They function exactly like other, shorter-term exchange-traded options."
## Leg(s) Legging: A term describing one option of a spread position.
"When someone ""legs"" into a call vertical, for example, he might do the long call trade first and does the short call trade later, hoping for a favorable price movement so the short side can be executed at a better price."
"Legging is a higher-risk method of establishing a spread position, and TD Ameritrade STRONGLY suggests that if you decide to leg into a spread, you should, for margin and risk purposes, do the long trades FIRST."
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
"## Leverage The ability to control of a larger amount of money or assets with a smaller amount of money or assets, typically done by borrowing money or using options."
"If prices move favorably for a leveraged position, the profits can be larger than on an unleveraged position."
"However, if prices move against a leveraged position, the losses can also be larger than on an unleveraged position, but not necessarily with an options position."
Buying stock on margin is using leverage.
"A long option position is leveraged because it ""controls"" a large number of shares with less money than it would take to maintain a position with the same number of shares."
"## Limit (Price) Order An order that has a limit on either price or time of execution, or both."
Compare to a market order that requires the order be filled at the most favorable price as soon as possible.
Limit orders to buy are usually placed below the current ask price.
Limit orders to sell are usually placed above the current bid price.
Limit orders can be used when trading spreads.
"In markets with low liquidity or in fast markets, some traders use limits to ensure getting filled by putting in a limit order to buy at or above the ask price or a limit order to sell at or below the bid price."
## Limited Power of Attorney An authorization giving someone other than the beneficial owner of an account the authority to make certain investment decisions regarding transactions in the clients account.
"## Limited Trading Authorization This authorization, usually provided by a limited power of attorney, grants someone other than the client to have trading privileges in an account."
These privileges are limited to purchases and sales; withdrawals of assets is not authorized.
"## Limit Move Relating to futures markets, a limit move is an increase or decrease of a futures price by the maximum amount allowed by the exchange for any one trading session."
"Price limits are established by the exchanges, and approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)."
Limit moves vary depending on the futures contract.
## Liquidation A transaction or transactions that offsets or closes out a stock or options position.
## Liquidity The ease with which a transaction in stock or options can take place without substantially affecting their price.
## Liquidity Risk The potential that an investor might not be able to buy or sell a security when desired.
## Listed Options An exchange-approved call or put traded on an options exchange with standardized terms.
Listed options are fully fungible.
"In contrast, over-the- counter (OTC) options usually have non-standard or negotiated terms."
## Listed Stock The stock of a corporation that is traded on a securities exchange.
## Loan Consent Agreement The agreement between a brokerage firm and its margin client permitting the brokerage firm to lend the margined securities to other brokers; this contract is part of the margin agreement.
## Loan Value The maximum amount of money that can be borrowed in a margin account at a brokerage firm using eligible securities as collateral.
## Local A term for a trader at the CBOT or CME who trades for his own account.
They compete with each other to provide the best bid and ask prices for futures.
Locals are basically the same type of traders that market makers are at the CBOE.
"## Locked Limit Refers to a futures market that has moved its daily maximum amount and, if the move is up, no one is willing to sell."
"Conversely, if the move is down, no one is willing to buy."
"Hence, the market is ""locked"" at the limit price with no trading."
"## Long As a noun, it refers to people who have bought stock or options."

"When the security closes higher than the previous close, all of the day's volume is considered up-volume."
A close lower than the previous day's results in all of the day's volume considered down-volume.
A rising OBV is defined as a sign of smart money flowing into a security.
"As the public then moves into the security, both the security and the OBV will surge ahead."
"If the price movement precedes the OBV movement, it is called a ""non- confirmation."""
Non-confirmations tend to occur at bull market tops or at bear market bottoms.
"When the security's price closes up, the day's OBV is created by adding the day's volume to the cumulative total."
The day's volume is subtracted from the cumulative total when the price closes down.

"The technical indicator comprises two MACD lines (daily and weekly), a relative daily MACD (the sum of the daily and the weekly MACDs), and the zero level."
"By default, the daily MACD plot is hidden; to make it visible, click on the DailyMACD tab of the Plots area and activate the Show plot checkbox."
"Note: in order to match the daily and the weekly time frames, all the numbers mentioned in this article are selected for usage with an aggregation period of 1 day."
The daily MACD line is calculated as the difference between a 12-day exponential moving average and a 26-day exponential moving average.
"Given there are five trading days a week, the EMA periods for the weekly MACD are five times longer: 60 days and 130 days, respectively."
The relative daily MACD is calculated as the sum of the daily MACD and the weekly MACD and thus tends to have less lag than the weekly MACD.
Potential trading signals may be found at crossovers of the relative daily MACD line with either of the other MACD lines or crossovers of the MACD lines with the zero level.
"Looking for divergences of the daily, weekly, or relative MACD from the price plot may also prove useful."

"The -1 sections can be interpreted as downtrend, and +1 sections might signify downtrend."
Values of this study are used in calculation of Trend Quality and Trend- Noise Balance indicators.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` fast length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of fast EMA.
` slow length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of slow EMA.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Periods ` | The Trend Periods plot.

TrendNoiseBalance TrendPersistenceRate ## Technical Analysis # CCI ## Description The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) expresses variation of a security's price based on its statistical mean.
"Using the CCI can help you identify excess buying or selling pressure when it crosses above the +100 level or below -100, respectively."
"However, the usage of CCI is not restricted to it: one can benefit from interpreting the CCI as a traditional oscillator in relation to certain overbought and oversold levels."
"By default, the CCI uses the 14 period timeframe in order to calculate the statistical mean, although short-term investors might want to reduce this number while long-term investors may extend it in order to create larger signals."
"Being a multi-faceted indicator, the CCI can be used in three common trading methods."
The first suggests looking for divergence between the price action and the CCI.
"The second method uses the -100 to +100 scale: as it was previously stated, readings falling out of this range tend to indicate the excessive buying or selling pressure."
"Finally, the third method involves analyzing CCI values in respect to zero line: when price action shows no sign of trending conditions, the CCI tends to fluctuate around the zero level, conversely, strong trends are believed to accelerate the CCI (see the example picture below)."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the CCI.
` over sold ` | Fixes the horizontal oversold line at a given level.
` over bought ` | Fixes the horizontal overbought line at the given level.
` show breakout signals ` | Controls visibility of breakout signals given by CCI.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` CCI ` | The Commodity Channel Index.
` OverBought ` | The overbought level.

The ZigZagSign plot connects swing points if the difference between their prices exceeds specified offset.
"A high swing point is a bar whose ` price ` is greater than that of the previous and the following bar; conversely, a low swing point is a bar whose ` price ` is lower than that of the previous and the following bar."
"Once all the irregularities are smoothed out, the study plot is a zigzag line showing generalized uptrend and downtrend segments of the price action."
"Visualization of this study includes chart label, chart bubbles, and plot coloring."
"Before the price change accumulates the specified amount, trend state is defined as ""Unconfirmed"", which results in chart label showing this state with amount accumulated, and study plot is colored orange."
"After a significant rise or fall, the plot is colored green (for ""Uptrend"") or red (for ""Downtrend""), each state is indicated with the chart label."
Each swing point (and the last bar on chart) is accompanied with chart bubble showing the price change relative to the prior swing point.

ZigZagHighLow plot identifies and connects swing points if the difference between their prices exceeds a certain calculated value.
This value is equal to the specified percentage of price change plus Average True Range (ATR) multiplied by a factor.
This sum can include an additional constant to increase the distance between the swing points.
"A high swing point is a bar with a selected price (high, low, open, or close) greater than that of the previous and the following bar."
"Conversely, a low swing point is a bar with a selected price lower than that of the previous and the following bar."
"Once all the irregularities are smoothed out, the study plot is a zigzag line showing generalized price moves up and down."
Note that the last segment of the plot can change its direction drastically as a considerable future market move may occur.
"In Sylvain Vervoorts sytems, market moves are regarded as complex and consisting of a certain number of moves up or down."
ZigZagHighLow can help visualize these moves.

"By design, you can simulate any number of market events and what if scenarios, all before ever placing actual capital at risk."
"Risk Profile Probability Analysis ## Technical Analysis # R2Trend ## Description As the first step, the R2Trend (RSquared) strategy calculates the RSquared , a technical indicator which measures how closely a data set of close prices conforms to the linear regression trendline."
"If the correlation is found to be higher than a certain threshold (the default value is 0.42), the strategy measures the steepness of the trendline, using Linear Regression Slope ."
"Based on the premise that steeper slopes signify stronger trends (when the absolute value of the slope found is greater than the specified value), the overall trending conditions are evaluated by the strategy as follows: RSquared values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters) and its own prior value while the trendline slope is greater than critical - read as indication of a strong uptrend; RSquared values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters) and its own prior value while the trendline slope is less than the negative critical - read as indication of a strong downtrend."
The first condition triggers a simulated buy-to open order if the close price rises above its own moving average.
"Vice versa, a simulated sell-to-open order is added when the second condition is true should the close price fall below the average."
"Simulated exit orders are added based on crossovers of the close price plot with its moving average: when the close price crosses below the average, a simulated sell-to-close order is added; when it crosses above - the simulation of buy-to-close takes place."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the RSquared.

Formatting Output: Part I You might have noticed how good all the built-in studies look when applied to chart.
"But so far we only learned how to display plots as plain lines, except for chapter 6 where we gave you a hint on how to display a plot as Boolean points: plot Crossover = Average(close, 5) crosses Average (close, 20); Crossover.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); This notation perfectly shows the common syntax for some of the Look and Feel functions."
These functions will surely add the finished look to your plots.
"But first things first, let us study the syntax using the ` SetPaintingStrategy ` function from the script above as an example."
Calling this function will command thinkScript to change representation of the values from line to points or arrows or histogram or many other shapes.
"In the script above, we declared the Crossover plot so, to change the way it is displayed, its name is going to be the first thing we type."
"After that, we put a dot and call the function by typing SetPaintingStrategy."
"And finally, we specify arguments for this function in parentheses; luckily, there is only one argument which happens to be a PaintingStrategy constant and dont forget the semicolon after the closing parenthesis."
"In the example above, we chose the Boolean points (with ` PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS ` ) constant it will put a dot at the Close price of those bars at which the crossover condition is true (i.e., where the 5 period SMA crosses the 20 period SMA)."
There are several other ways of representing Boolean values.
Consider using BOOLEAN_ARROW_DOWN and BOOLEAN_ARROW_UP painting strategies.
"These can be especially useful in a script like this one: plot isAbove = Average(close, 5) crosses above Average (close, 20); plot isBelow = Average(close, 5) crosses below Average (close, 20); isAbove.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_UP); isBelow.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_DOWN); Now you will see an up arrow below those bars at which the shorter moving average crosses above the longer one and down arrow above those bars when it crosses below."
There are also numerous ways to display the numerical plots.
"First of all, the line can be complemented with points, squares, or triangles which would definitely focus your attention on the values the line has at each bar (for this purpose, use LINE_VS_POINTS, LINE_VS_SQUARES, or LINE_VS_TRIANGLES)."
"You can even discard the line and use only these basic shapes: POINTS, SQUARES, or TRIANGLES constants should be used then."
"Some values need to be represented as a histogram, use the HISTOGRAM constants for those."
There are several other interesting painting strategies; the full list can be found here .
"If you, however, prefer to keep the line, there are many options to make it look differently."
"For example, the ` SetStyle ` function."
"Consider the following script: plot avg = ExpAverage(close, 15); avg.SetStyle(Curve.SHORT_DASH); Now the EMA line will be displayed as a short-dashed curve."
"The ` SetStyle ` function accepts ` Curve ` constants, the full list and descriptions can be found here ."
"` SetLineWeight ` function is very simple to use: specify a number from 1 to 5 as an argument and it will define the width of the plot line in pixels: plot avg = ExpAverage(close, 15); avg.SetLineWeight(3); Sometimes there are situations where you need to hide a plot; there are two functions to help you with that: ` Hide ` and ` SetHiding ` ."
"First function will hide the plot by default while the second will only hide it dynamically, i.e., upon some condition: plot SMA5 = Average(close, 5); plot SMA10 = Average(close, 10); plot SMA15 = Average(close, 15); SMA10.hide(); SMA15.setHiding(getAggregationPeriod() < AggregationPeriod.DAY); In this example, plot ` SMA10 ` plot is hidden by default and the ` SMA15 ` is hidden on intraday charts only."
In previous chapter we promised to tell you more about colors that can be used when drawing plots.
"You can color plots using any of the following functions: ` SetDefaultColor ` , ` AssignValueColor ` , or ` AssignNormGradientColor ` ."
` SetDefaultColor ` is used to add a specific solid color to the whole plot.
` AssignValueColor ` is used to draw the plot with different colors depending on specified conditions.
` AssignNormGradientColor ` is used to color the plot in the gradient manner depending on values.
"Before we move on to examples showing how to use these functions, lets see how to specify which colors we will need."
"First way is to use a predefined Color constant, e.g, Color.RED (this is what we actually did in the previous chapter when assigning colors to strategy signals)."
Second way is to use functions ` Color ` and ` DefineColor ` : the former draws the plot with colors named by the latter function.
Another way is to use the ` GetColor ` function which accepts a number as an argument and returns the respective color from the palette; this palette can be found here .
"For those who find our palettes insufficient, we have the ` CreateColor ` function which accepts three numerical arguments used as RGB values in order to create whichever color you might think of."
"And finally, function ` TakeValueColor ` will color the plot the same way as another plot; this is especially useful when colors of the plot change dynamically."
"Now that you are provided you with a whole lot of functions, lets see how they work together: plot UpperBand = close 1.1; plot LowerBand = close 0.9; plot Middle = close; Middle.DefineColor(""Highest"", Color.RED); Middle.DefineColor(""Lowest"", CreateColor(250, 150, 25)); LowerBand.SetDefaultColor(GetColor(5)); UpperBand.AssignValueColor(LowerBand.TakeValueColor()); Middle.AssignNormGradientColor(14, Middle.color(""Highest""), Middle.color(""Lowest"")); So, we started with drawing two bands of the Close price-based envelope: two bands shifted up and down by 10 percent from the ` Middle ` band which is the Close price plot."
"After that, we used the ` DefineColor ` function to define two named colors for the ` Middle ` plot: ` Highest ` and ` Lowest ` ."
The ` Highest ` color is defined by this function using the Color constant: ` Color.RED ` .
"In order to specify the value of ` Lowest ` color, we had the ` CreateColor ` function translate RGB value (250, 150, 25) into argument of the ` DefineColor ` function."
After that we used the ` SetDefaultColor ` function to paint the ` LowerBand ` in a solid color taken from the dynamic palette by the ` GetColor ` function and made sure that ` UpperBand ` would be colored the same (by using functions ` AssignValueColor ` and ` TakeValueColor ` ).
"And still the result was not colorful enough to us so, we decided to add gradient coloring to the Middle plot with ` Highest ` color for highest values and ` Lowest ` color for lowest ones."
"Of course, we do not expect you to use all these functions in a single script, however, you may try."
"Also, if you feel tired of the plots, lets move on to next chapter as there are several other ways to output values for you study."

Alerts Chart Studies ## Technical Analysis # SVEStochRSI ## Description SVEStochRSI is a modification of the Stochastic RSI oscillator introduced by Sylvain Vervoort.
"Instead of just positioning the RSI value within the high- low range of RSI, this oscillator calculates the average relative position and the regular high-low range is replaced by its average value."
Using average values instead of regular ones allows the oscillator to take into account more data and smooth out plot irregularities.
SVEStochRSI can be used for confirmation of trend reversals/continuation based on divergences and convergences of price and indicator: Positive divergence occurs when the price makes a lower bottom while the oscillator makes a higher one.
This may signify a trend reversal.
Positive convergence occurs when both the price and the indicator are in uptrend while making a higher top or bottom.
"In this case, trend is likely to continue."
Positive hidden divergence is detected when the price shows a higher bottom while oscillator shows a lower bottom.
"In this case, trend is also likely to continue."
"Negative divergence is detected when the price hits a higher top, but the oscillator shows a lower top."
Trend reversal is possible.
Negative convergence appears when both the price and the indicator are decreasing while making lower tops or bottoms.
This may signify continuation of the downtrend.
Negative hidden divergence is observed when the price makes a lower high while the indicator hits a higher high.
This may confirm continuation of the downtrend.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` rsi length ` | The length used to calculate the RSI.
` stoch length ` | The period on which RSI range is to be found.
` average length ` | The length used to calculate the moving averages.
` over bought ` | The overbought level.
` over sold ` | The oversold level.
"` show breakout signals ` | Set this parameter to ""no"" to hide breakout signals."
The signals are given when the StochRSI plot crosses above the oversold level or below the overbought level.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` StochRSI ` | The SVEStochRSI oscillator plot.
` OverBought ` | The overbought level.
` OverSold ` | The oversold level.
` UpSignal ` | A signal given when StochRSI crosses above the oversold level.
` DownSignal ` | A signal given when StochRSI crosses below the overbought level.

Values for this argument must be in the [-1;1] range.
"## Example 1 declare lower; plot Data = Asin(0.5) == Double.Pi / 3; Similar to the ` ACos ` example, the code above compares two values and draws the unit ( ` true ` ) plot if they are equal."
"If the values are not equal, the zero ( ` false ` ) plot is drawn."
"As the arc sine of ` 0.5 ` is not equal ` pi/3 ` , the example script draws the zero plot."

"Being part of a system described in BC Low's article ""Identify the Start of a Trend with DMI"", it gives especially strong signals when used in combination with TAC_ADX ."
"TAC_DIPlus plots three lines, each being the DI+ component of DMI with certain length; signals are given when the three lines cluster in the bottom of the subgraph."
"The basic rule of using TAC_DIPlus is finding clusters at or below the basic reference level of 10; when the lowest line reaches level 5, it is supposed a stronger signal."
The confirmation of the bullish reversal is suggested when the cluster turns up from level 5.
"For stronger signals, use TAC_DIPlus along with TAC_ADX."
"For double confirmation that market bottom is formed, look for TAC_DIPlus clusters in 5..10 range when TAC_ADX turns down from level 90."

HACOLT ## Technical Analysis # FirstHourBreakout ## Description The First-Hour Breakout strategy adds simulated orders based on the price range calculated for the first hour of the regular trading session.
"By default, it also compares the volume traded last night to the average nightly volume over the last five days (see the article on the Cumulative Overnight Volume for details)."
"In addition to the first-hour range check and the overnight volume check, the strategy performs several checks at specified timestamps during the trading day."
"Note that since thinkScript uses timestamps in Eastern Standard Time (EST), the default numbers in the input parameters are adjusted accordingly."
The simulated orders will be added based on the following algorithm (all timestamps mentioned are default and can be modified using the input parameters): 1.
"At 8:30 am Central Standard Time (CST), the strategy compares the total volume traded last night to the average nightly volume over the last five days."
"If the overnight volume is greater than the average, the strategy detects a volatility bias and will perform the next step."
"If the overnight volume is less than or equal to the average, no simulated orders will be added during this day and the check will be repeated at the same time the next day."
2.
"At 9:30 am CST, the strategy registers the price range of the first hour of the trading day."
3.
"If the price rises above or falls below this range at any moment from 9:45 a.m. CST to 2:45 pm CST, the strategy will add a simulated order: a buy to open order when the price rises and a sell to open order when it falls."
No simulated orders to open will be added after 2:45 pm CST.
4.
All open simulated positions will be closed with the opposite simulated orders at 3:15 pm CST.
Note that you can turn off the overnight volume check by setting the ` use filter ` parameter to ` no ` .
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` night session from midnight ` | Defines the start of the midnight trading session in the EST time zone, 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` first hour trading ` | Defines the start of the day trading session in the EST time zone, 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` main session ` | Defines the start of the main session (by default, one hour after the market opens) in the EST time zone 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` no more long positions ` | Defines the end time for adding simulated orders to open in the EST timezone, 24-hour hhmm notation."
"` night session from main session end ` | Defines the end of the main session in the EST time zone, 24-hour hhmm notation."

"Sometimes, the best way to solve this problem is to use the same indicator with multiple lengths."
"However, this type of visualization is narrow in scope and you can always miss the right lookback period."
"In thinkorswim Charts, this issue can be addressed by using a feature called Thermo Mode."
"Thermo Mode enables an indicator to display values of a plot using numerous lookback periods, assigning specified colors to lowest and highest values."
Values in the middle are converted to gradient colors between the specified ones.
"In the example below, high values of the RSI study are converted to purple, low values, to green."
Long streaks of purple/green color indicate that the value was at its highest/lowest level for a long time; small surges of purple/green color indicate that the value is at its highest/lowest level on a short term.
For illustrative purposes only.

Fibonacci fans share the main idea with Fibonacci retracements : using Fibonacci ratios in order to predict future support/resistance levels.
"On an uptrend period, it is suggested that the main trendline be plotted from the bottom to top so that retracement lines are placed below it; these lines might predict potential support levels."
"Conversely, on a downtrend section, the fan is plotted from the top to bottom, the retracement lines appear above the main trendline, serving as potential resistance levels."
"In order to add the Fibonacci fans drawing to chart, choose it from the Active Tool menu."
Specify begin and end points of the trendline (consider using peaks and troughs for these purpose); the retracement lines will be added automatically.
## Properties Appearance: Visible.

## How do I change the columns on the option chain?
"From the ""Trade Tab"" under ""All Products"", type an underlying security then click on the arrow next to ""Option Chain"" to expand the chain, which is sorted by expiration."
"Please note; If the underlying does not have an option chain, no options will appear."
"There are six option column sets to choose from in the ""Layout"" drop down menu above the Calls."
"Click on this drop down and choose from one of the pre-built sets, or choose ""Customize..."" and select your own columns from the list on the left, using the ""Add Item"" or ""Remove Item"" buttons."
"When you are done making your selections, Click ""OK"" to view your changes."
The six pre-installed options column sets are also fully customizable as well.
Simply choose one and then follow the steps above.
"When you are finished customizing, you can save your set for quick access by clicking on the ""Layout"" drop down and selecting ""Save as...""."
"In the pop up, enter in a name and then click ""Save""."
"You can now choose your new set by clicking on the ""Layout"" drop down, as it will be listed in the menu towards the bottom."
## What are all the various ways that I can place a trade?
Thinkorswim is built for traders by traders.
With that in mind you can click on any Bid or Ask on the platform.
If you click on Bid you will bring up sell order ticket.
If you click on Ask you will bring up a buy order ticket.
"From there you can adjust you price, quantity and type of order."
"Then press Confirm and Send in the lower right, review your trade and then send the order."
## How do I access level II quotes?
We have a couple easy ways to access Level II Quotes.
"From the Trade, All Products page click on the down arrow next to trade grid and type in a symbol you wish to view."
You can also bring up a Level II on the bottom of any chart.
"From the Charts tab, while you have a symbol charted, look on the far right had side and you will see a sidebar."
The second tool from the bottom is Level II.
Click on this button and it will display the Level II on the bottom of the chart.
_Access to real-time data is subject to acceptance of the exchange agreements.
Level II Quotes are free to non-professional subscribers.
Professional access and fees differ.
"For details, see our Professional Rates & Fees ."
_ ## How do I place an OCO order?
Within the platform follow Trade > All Products.
"At the bottom left of this section, click on the up arrow tab to open the ""Order Entry Tools""."
"On the lower left of the order entry, select ""Advanced Order:"" and in the drop down choose ""OCO""."
"Now, pull up the buy or sell order you want in the ""Order Entry"" section and adjust the price for your Limit order."
"Then, right click anywhere on the exitsing order line and choose ""Create duplicate order"" in the menu."
Adjust this second order to the Stop activation price of your choosing.
_Keep in mind that a limit order guarantees a price but not an execution.
Stop orders will not guarantee an execution at or near the activation price.
"Once activated, they compete with other incoming market orders._ ## Can I place an option order based off the price of the underlying security?"
You certainly are able to place an option order based off the underlying price of the stock.
"First, place your order in the ""Order Entry"" section."
Then click on the gear icon to the far right of the order.
"This will bring up the ""Order Rules"" where you will be able to place your ""Conditions"" on the order, which you can read in the ""Order Description"" at the bottom of the page."
"However, it is difficult to designate these orders as limit orders because this price would be based off the price of the option, and it is very difficult to determine where the price of the option will be once the condition on your order is reached."
"You may want to consider placing these types of orders as market orders, if you are willing to accept the fill price when the condition is reached, of course."
"Or set them up, linked to something other than price, that is to say a different type of trigger; for example, mark tick offset, etc."
## How can I switch back and forth between live trading and paper money?
The selection for Paper Trading or Live Trading can be made only on the login screen.
Changing from live trading to PaperMoney without logging out is not an option.
"However, a Live Trading account and a Paper Trading account can be open at the same time, and then the only requirement is switching between active windows."
## How do I add or remove options from the options chain?
"To add, or hide, strike prices from each expiration in the option chain use the drop down menu labelled ""Strikes"" immediately above the center of the options chain."
Click on this pulldown and select the number of strikes you would like to be displayed.
"If the number you would like to see is not in the drop-down list, you can also type in a custom number of strikes to display in this menu."
## Where can I find weekly options on the thinkorswim platform?
"Go to the Trade>All Products tab, enter the underlying symbol in the symbol field and expand the Option Chain below the Underlying section."
All weeklys will be labeled in bold with parentheses around them.
Quarterlys and non- standard option series will also be listed this way.
"If you do not see the weeklys, make sure you go to Setup>Application Settings>General>Display and check the box next to Show Weeklys and Quarterlys' and/or 'Minis'."
## When are weekly options listed/available for trading?
Please note that weeklys will be listed on Thursdays and available for trading thereafter.
"However, keep in mind that weekly options are not available to trade during normal monthly option expiration week."
The new weeklys for the following week will be made available on Thursday of expiration week.
"_Because they are short-lived instruments, weekly options positions require close monitoring, as they can be subject to significant volatility."
Profits can disappear quickly and can even turn into losses with a very small movement of the underlying asset._ ## What does the number in parentheses mean next to the option series?
The number in parentheses represents the number of days left until expiration.
## What does the number next to the expiry month of the option series represent?
The number next to the expiry month represents the week of the month the particular option series expires.
## How do I create an entry order with an OCO bracket closing order attached (aka 1st Triggers OCO)?
The easiest way to create a 1st Triggers OCO order is by pulling up the symbol on the Trade>All Products tab and right-clicking on the bid or ask price of the product you wish to trade and selecting BUY Custom>With OCO Bracket or SELL Custom>With OCO Bracket.
This is the quickest and most efficient method to create the order.
"After adjusting the order to your specifications, click Confirm and Send and review the Order Confirmation Dialog prior to clicking SEND."
You can also create the order manually.
"To do so, pull up the initial entry order in the Order Entry window by left-clicking on the bid or ask price of the product."
"Next, change the Advanced Order drop down in the lower left corner of the Order Entry window and select 1st trgs OCO."
"Then, you will right-click on the order and select Create Opposite Order."
Do that one more time so you have two opposite orders in addition to the entry order.
"Next, change the orders on the OCO bracket accordingly."
Review your order and send when you are ready.
Please make sure you keep sufficient funds or positions in your account to support conditional orders and other programmed trades.
"## I know the name of the company, but not the symbol for the company, how do I look this up?"
Go to Trade>All Products and click on the small down arrow next to the symbol entry box to the far top left of the screen.
"From here, click on the lookup tab and begin typing the name of the company or ETF and this will assist you in finding what you are looking for."
## Why doesnt the Company Profile button show for all symbols?
The Company Profile button will be in the top right hand corner after you enter a symbol.
This is currently available for 225 symbols but we will expand this with time.
## What is Market Maker Move?
Market Maker Move is a measure of the expected magnitude of price movement based on market volatility.
"We arrive at this calculation by using stock price, volatility differential, and time to expiration."
It helps to identify the implied move due to an event between now and the front month expiration (if an event exists).
## Is Market Maker Move a measure of expected daily movement?
It is better to say that Market Maker Move is a measure of the implied move based of volatility differential between the front and back month.
This is useful in cases where an event (i.e.
earnings) takes place in the front month and one would like to estimate the implied move due to that event.
## Are weeklys and quarterly options included in the Market Maker Move?
Yes.
The calculation does include any near term and next near term expiration.
## Why do I see Market Maker Move on some underlyings but not others?
The filter is based on Volatility differential.
If the differential is positive the MMM will be displayed.
"If negative, it will not."
"In other words, if the near term expiration has greater volatility than the back month, the MMM value will show."
## What is the difference between a Stop and Stop Limit?
"The difference between a STOP and STOPLIMIT is that a STOP order will turn into a MARKET order as soon as the STOP is triggered, whereas the STOPLIMIT will turn into a LIMIT order as soon as the STOP is triggered."
The risk with a STOPLIMIT is that it may not be filled at all if it touches the STOP price and then does not meet the LIMIT or better.
The risk with a STOP is that you are not guaranteed the STOP price as it turns into a MARKET order when it is triggered.
## Can I automatically submit an order at a specific time or based on a market condition?
"Yes, this is a conditional order."
You can set this up from the Order Entry box after you enter your order.
Click on the small gray gear on the right hand side of the order and this will bring up the Order Rules box.
"From here, you can set the conditions that you would like."
## What does ETB and HTB mean in the upper right corner of the Trade>All Products tab?
This tells you if a security is Easy to Borrow or Hard to Borrow.
"This relates to shorting a security, if there is an ETB distinction, you should be able to short the security."
"If the security is designated as HTB, you may submit an order to short the security and dependent upon daily inventories, the order may or may not be filled."
"Short sell orders, ETB or HTB, are only good for the day and cannot be entered GTC as daily inventories can change."
## How can I change my Default order quantity?
"Click on Setup>Application Settings >Order Defaults and you can adjust your defaults for Stocks, Options, Futures, Futures Options and Forex."
## What is the difference between Flatten and Flatten Now in Active Trader?
"If you click the Flatten button, a confirmation window will appear asking you to confirm that you would like to flatten your current position, effectively zeroing out the position at the market."
"If you wish to flatten your position without having to confirm Yes in the resulting pop-up window, instead click the Flatten Now button."
Your position will immediately be closed at the market without a confirmation window popping-up.
## What is the difference between Reverse and Reverse Now in Active Trader?
"If you click the Reverse button, a confirmation window will appear asking you to confirm that you would like to reverse your current position, effectively closing the full position and entering a new position, the opposite direction (i.e."
"you are long 100 shares, reverse the position to be short -100 shares), both the closing and opening orders filled at the market."
"If you wish to reverse your position without having to confirm Yes in the resulting pop-up window, instead click the Reverse Now button."
Your closing/opening orders will immediately be sent at the market without a confirmation window popping-up.
## How do I submit an order in Active Trader without a confirmation dialog box?
"If you would like to send orders without receiving a confirmation dialog box, you may consider enabling the Auto Send feature."
Simply check the box next to Auto Send in the upper right corner of the Active Trader ladder.
"Please be aware that by enabling this tool, any orders you send through the Active Trader ladder will be sent immediately without the confirmation dialog box."

"Example: For the S&P 500, Russell 2000, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq 100 Index futures, during non US trading hours (5 PM to 8:30 am Central Time) Limit Down is set at 7%, based off of the 3 pm central time futures fixing price."
"During that time, if the /ES, or /MES goes 7% down from the 3 pm central fixing futures price, limit down rules will be in effect."
"The contract will continue to trade, but cannot be traded lower than the limit down price, until US trading hours open at 8:30 am central time."

"During that time, if the /ES, or /MES goes up 7% from the 3 pm central fixing futures price, limit up rules will be in effect."
"The contract will continue to trade, but cannot be traded higher than the limit up price, until US trading hours open at 8:30 am central time."
## Can limit up occur during US trading hours?

During US trading hours only limit down rules apply.
"## What happens if the underlying index goes 7% or 13% down during US trading hours (8:30 am- 2:25 PM Central time) If the underlying index hits level 1 (7%) or level 2 (13%) during us trading hours, trading of futures products tied to S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Russell 2000 will be halted for 10 minutes, and will resume trading 10 minutes regulatory halt commenced."

Per FINRA regulations you are limited to 3 day trades in a five rolling business day period.
A day trade is considered the opening and closing of the same position within the same day.
"If you maintain a net liq of $25,000 or more, you may day trade freely."
Please be advised that the day trading rules were enacted by FINRA and cannot be avoided if you want to trade on US Exchanges.
"For more detail regarding this regulation, please see below: _Effective September 28th, 2001 the NYSE and NASD imposed a $25,000 minimum equity requirement for 'pattern day traders.'"
"Consistent with the new margin rules, if a customer's margin account falls under $25,000 and the customer has opened and closed positions on the same day three times within five days, the customer will not be allowed to open new positions until the $25,000 requirement is restored."

because the cash collected when selling these positions increase your margin equity instead of decreasing your margin requirement.
## Why are mini options the same price as regular options?
"This is because mini options only represent 10 shares, not 100."
"If you are buying an option, you may notice that the mini option and regular option may both be trading for $1.00 at the same strike price."
"However, the regular option would cost $100 whereas the mini option would only cost $10 (not including commissions)."

to while ## Technical Analysis # Reflex ## Description The Reflex indicator helps reveal market data cycles.
It is based on a model that regards market data as a combination of data cycles and short-term trends.
"In this model, trends start at a cycle peak or valley and end at the adjacent peak or valley, correspondingly."
"Carefully selecting the projected cycle length and analyzing the values of the Reflex indicator, one can identify the turning points as stipulated by this model."
The Reflex indicator is calculated using the following algorithm: 1.
The price data is run through the EhlersSuperSmootherFilter .
2.
A presumed trend length is calculated based on the selected indicator (cycle) length.
3.
A root mean square of the average distance between the trendline and price points is found.
4.
The ratio of the average distance to its root mean square yields the Reflex indicator value.
"When the indicator is at its maximum, a peak-to-peak trend may have come to an end."
"When the indicator is at its minimum, a valley-to-valley trend may have come to an end."

Five states are considered when calculating upper and lower band levels.
Use the following flowchart to retrace the Darvas Box calculation mechanism.
"Band levels are calculated on the bar-by-bar basis, starting from the first bar on chart, which is assigned State I."
"In state V, both upper and lower bands are plotted from the first bar to the intersection of either band with the price plot."
"If such an intersection occurs, a Buy or Sell signal is generated."
"The intersected bar is assigned State I, the bands fracture at the previous bar, and new upper and lower bands are calculated using the intersected bar as the first in the sequence."
"Buy signals are generated when the upper band is breached, and Sell signals are generated upon intersection with lower band."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Upper Band ` | The upper band plot.
` Lower Band ` | The lower band plot.
` Buy Signal ` | Boolean plot marking Buy signals.
` Sell Signal ` | Boolean plot marking Sell signals.

"Based on the assumption that the price data is cyclic, using the Bandpass Filter may help single out the components to be further used by the Fourier Series Indicator ."
"The Fourier Series Indicator converts the input price data into waveshapes, which may help identify trends and cyclic turning points."
"To properly isolate the primitive components, the following values need to be determined: Cycle period: The amount of bars in the primary cyclic component in the data."
Bandwidth: The tolerance of the measurement of the cycle period.
Harmonic: The order of the cyclic component in the wave.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The amount of bars in the primary cyclic component in the data.

BalanceOfMarketPower BBDivergence ## Technical Analysis # McClellanSummationIndex ## Description The McClellan Summation Index is a long-term indicator calculated based on values of McClellan Oscillator .
Two modes of calculation are available for this study: cumulative and non-cumulative.
"The cumulative mode suggests that the index be equal to cumulative sum of McClellan Oscillator values, i.e., at any given bar it equals to the sum of all preceding values."
"The second mode uses McClellan Oscillator and two exponential moving averages (EMAs) : a 10% percent and 5% EMAs of market breadth (which can be simple or ratio-adjusted; for details, see the McClellan Oscillator article) are subtracted from the oscillator value."
Note that default ` length ` input parameters for the EMAs match the mentioned percentage values.
The McClellan Summation Index can be used to measure the uptrend strength.
"In the ratio-adjusted mode, the strong uptrend can be signified by index values going from below -500 to well above +500; in this mode the indicator is plotted around the zero level."
"In the simple mode, the indicator is plotted around the +1000 level and uptrend is recognized when the values rise from negative to well above +2000."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` exchange ` | Defines market to use advance/decline data from.
` fast length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the fast EMA.
` slow length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the slow EMA.
` ratio adjusted ` | Defines whether or not to use the ratio-adjusted mode of market breadth calculation.

Spearman Spreads ## Technical Analysis # Descending Triangle The Descending Triangle is defined by two lines: a horizontal support line running through bottoms and a downtrend line drawn through the peaks.
"While two peaks belonging to the same trendline would suffice for pattern recognition, the pattern might prove more reliable when there are more."
"This describes perfect conditions for the Descending Triangle formation, which means that overall signal strength is set to maximum."
"However, this is relatively rare, so, in the majority of cases, the support line could have a slight slope or both the trendline and the support line will be pierced by false intrabar breakouts."
"This could cause some problems as false breakouts might be easily confused with the true ones when, in fact, the price is going to retreat back into the triangle."
"Descending Triangles are generally seen as bearish continuation patterns, however, they can be occasionally observed in uptrends, in which case a major trend reversal might be expected."
"In terms of breakouts, this pattern is also somewhat ambivalent as the escape from the Descending Triangle can happen in both directions."
"Statistically, downward breakouts are more likely to occur, but upward ones seem to be more reliable."
"Among the upward breakouts, the most desirable to find are those that happen after a gap."
Larger gaps seem to leave less chance for the price to retreat back into the triangle.
"Note that statistically this rule is only approved for the upward breakouts; for the downward ones, gapping proves to have little to no effect."
"In course of pattern formation, volume is most likely to fall."
Channel Up Double Bottom is only approved for the upward breakouts; ## Technical Analysis # TrendNoiseBalance ## Description The Trend-Noise Balance study is a trend-analyzing technical indicator which relates trend to noise in an oscillator format.
It is based on calculation of cumulative price change (CPC); this value is reset to zero after each trend reversal indicated by Trend Periods (values switching from -1 to 1 or vice versa).
"Values around the +50 level indicate that trend and noise are in equilibrium, while values close to 100 can signify strong trending conditions, and values close to 0 suggest that the trend is weak."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` fast length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of fast EMA of Trending Periods.
` slow length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of slow EMA of Trending Periods.
` trend length ` | The number of bars upon which the trend is defined.

Trendflex TrendPeriods ## Technical Analysis # PPS ## Description Person's Pivot Study (PPS) is a bullish and bearish momentum indicator.
"In addition, it has two proprietary moving average settings that help visualize either a bullish or bearish market condition."
"When an arrow points up and prices as defined by the close and/or the open and close relationship of each respective time period is above both moving average values, traders can look to take trades from the long side."
"Inversely when an arrow is pointing down and the close and/or the open and close relationship of each respective time period is below both moving average values, traders can look to take trades from the short side."
This aids in determining the trend as the moving averages in an uptrend will act as support and in a downtrend will act as resistance.
"When combined with Person's Pivots, the PPS study helps to confirm trades against the predetermined support and resistance target levels."

FW_MOBO_Advanced MOBO (Momentum Breakout Bands) study suggests that all markets and stock prices have a period ... ## Technical Analysis # CondensedCandles ## Description The Condensed Candles study designed by Dave Cline is an attempt to extract additional information from common candlesticks, introducing the concept of candle signature."
"The candle signature is a combination of three integer numbers (HO, HC, and OL) calculated for each candlestick on chart."
The signature is characteristic of candle shape and thus can be used in detection of signature patterns: the frequency of a particular signature occurrence might give you an insight into subsequent price action.
"Before the signature parts (HO, HC, and OL) are calculated, you need to decide how fine you prefer the signature patterns to be, which is determined by the ""segments"" input parameter."
Using a small number for this parameter will limit the total number of possible signatures to a relatively small value.
"For example, setting the parameter to three will provide 64 possible signatures."
"Using a larger number, e.g., nine, will amplify the granularity of candle definition, yielding 1,000 possible signatures."
"Once you have set the parameters, the HO, HC, and OL values are calculated using the following algorithm: Calculation of segment divisor."
Segment divisor is equal to 100 divided by the segment count.
"The segment count is the number you specified for the ""segments"" input parameter."
Calculation of average range.
Average range is equal to a simple moving average of range (high minus low).
Calculation of range multiplier.
Range multiplier is equal to the ratio of candle range to average range.
These values are rounded down and the signature conforms to the following notion: HO:HC:OL.
The study then uses the calculated signatures to indicate the following: Candles with three most frequently occurring signatures.
Labels displaying the percentage of times that following candle(s) closed greater than the signature candle.
Labels displaying the average return (in price units) of the difference between the following candle(s) and the signature candle.
Using both the statistical data and the visual aspect of the study helps you evaluate the probability of future returns.
## Input Parameters ` segments ` | Defines the signature pattern granularity.
Greater values of this parameter yield greater numbers of possible signatures.
---|--- ` length ` | Defines the lookup period for candles following the signature candle.
"For example, setting this value to 3 will have the label show the percentage of times that three following candles closed greater than the signature candle."
"` show bubbles ` | Setting this parameter to ""no"" will turn off the bubbles displaying candle signatures."
"` show label ` | Setting this parameter to ""no"" will turn off the label displaying the percentage and the average return."
## Plots ` S1 ` | Marks candles with the most frequently occurring signature.
---|--- ` S2 ` | Marks candles with the second most frequently occurring signature.
` S3 ` | Marks candles with the third most frequently occurring signature.

## Technical Analysis # HiLoActivator ## Description The HiLo Activator study is a trend-following indicator introduced by Robert Krausz as part of the Gann Swing trading strategy.
"In addition to indicating the current trend direction, this can be used as both entry signal and trailing stop."
Here is how the HiLo Activator is calculated: 1.
The system calculates the moving averages of the high and low prices over the last several candles.
"By default, the average is calculated using the last three candles."
2.
"If the close price falls below the average low or rises above the average high, the system plots the opposite moving average."
"For example, if the price crosses above the average high, the system will plot the average low."
"If the price crosses below the average low afterward, the system will stop plotting the average low and will start plotting the average high, and so forth."
The plot of the HiLo Activator thus consists of sections on the top and bottom of the price plot.
The sections on the bottom signify bullish trending conditions.
"Vice versa, those on the top signify the bearish conditions."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The period on which the average high and low prices are to be found.
"## Plots Parameter | Description ---|--- ` BuyStop ` | The buy stop level, a moving average of the high price."
"` SellStop ` | The sell stop level, a moving average of the low price."

EXECUTION_PRICE ## Technical Analysis # CPMO ## Description The Compare Price Momentum Oscillator (CPMO) is a technical indicator developed by Vitali Apirine.
It allows comparison of the relative strength of two stocks or indexes based on Carl Swenlin's Price Momentum Oscillator .
"For both of the specified symbols (stocks or indexes), the study plots a PMO line and a signal line."
The four lines can then be analyzed in relation to each other and the zero level.
"To make sure the comparison is possible, the same input parameters are used when calculating PMO lines and signal lines for both symbols."
"While the plain PMO indicator suggests looking for crossovers of the main PMO line with the signal line, the CPMO study makes it easier to look for crossovers of the main PMO lines of the primary and secondary stock or index."
Such crossovers may help understand which stock or index is outperforming the other.
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length1 ` | The length of the first exponential moving average to smooth the rate of change with, applied to both the primary and secondary symbol."
"` length2 ` | The length of the second exponential moving average to smooth the rate of change with, applied to both the primary and secondary symbol."

CorrelationTrendIndicator CSI ## How to thinkorswim # thinkScript: Q&A What is thinkScript?
"thinkScript is a built-in programming language that gives you the capability of creating your own analysis tools such as studies, strategies, watchlist columns, etc."
"In thinkScript, you decide which kind of data to analyze with which methods."
Functions present in this programming language are capable of retrieving both market and fiscal historical data and provide you with numerous techniques to process it.
You are even able to combine many technical indicators in one by referencing them in your code or just using functions that represent the most popular studies such as simple or exponential moving average.
How do I learn to script?
We suggest you start with a set of tutorials weve prepared for you.
You can find them here .
Each tutorial comes with a quiz so you can check your knowledge.
"If you already know how to create a script but are unsure what function or constant to use, you can go to our thinkScript Reference page."

"Instead of counting up and down days from Close to Close (like the RSI does), the Relative Momentum Index counts up and down days from the Close relative to a Close several days ago."
"As with all overbought/oversold indicators, the RMI exhibits similar strengths and weaknesses."
"In strong trending markets, the RMI will remain at overbought or oversold levels for an extended period."
"In non-trending markets, the RMI tends to predictably oscillate between an overbought level of 70 to 90 and an oversold level of 10 to 30."
"When the RSI diverges from the price, the price will eventually correct to the direction of the index."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the RMI.
` momentum ` | The number of bars to go back to find the past closing price.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` RMI ` | The Relative Momentum Index.

See also ` GetAggregationPeriod ` function in the Others section.
FOUR_MIN TEN_MIN def agg = AggregationPeriod.FIVE_MIN; plot data = close(period = agg); ## Technical Analysis # Rectangle The Rectangle pattern is defined by two parallel lines that run horizontally through peaks and bottoms.
Each trendline needs to contain at least two peaks or bottoms.
"While the perfect picture of the Rectangle, where the overall signal strength is set to maximum, suggests that trendlines be strictly horizontal, in real life they might have a slight slope."
Note that in this case they still need to be parallel and the performance will be somewhat impaired.
Rectangles are known for their versatility: they serve as both continuation and reversal patterns in both uptrend and downtrend conditions.
"Odds of reversal or continuation in downtrend are statistically about the same, but in the uptrend, the continuation scenario is more probable."
"Since the statistics are not too helpful, it might be a good idea to look for some early warnings."
"Fortunately, Rectangles act like Channels in this matter: price shortfalls often predict the breakout direction."
"In downtrend, failure to reach either trendline signifies with good probability that price will break through the other."
"Things are a bit more complicated when the preceding trend is upward: failure to reach the lower line usually correctly predicts the breach of the upper, while odds of breaking through the lower line after a partial rise are only satisfactory."
"In both uptrends and downtrends, volume is more likely to fall over the course of the pattern formation."
"When the preceding trend is downward, heavy volume at breakout substantially improves the strength of signal."
"After the uptrend, however, volume at breakout does not seem to help."

MedianAverage MESASineWave ## Technical Analysis # Triangle The Triangle pattern is sometimes called the Symmetrical Triangle since it does not have a defined slope as do its ascending and descending types.
"With the only difference being the absence of a horizontal support/resistance line, its geometry is the same as in two other triangle patterns: the price is bounded between two converging lines."
Each line needs to contain at least two peaks or bottoms.
The close resemblance between the Symmetrical and Ascending and Descending Triangles already implies that it has to share their properties.
"This is true: appearing in both uptrends and downtrends, it delivers breakouts of either direction, each trend/breakout combination being equally probable."
"Throughout the pattern formation, volume is most likely to fall, but, as in several other patterns, breakouts on heavy volume show better results."

Impulse Inertia and currencies; ## Technical Analysis # AccumulationDistribution ## Description The Accumulation/Distribution study is a technical indicator created by Dominico D'Errico.
The main purpose of this indicator is to help identify accumulation and distribution market phases described in Dow theory.
"As both phases are characterized by price range compression, the indicator compares the current price range with its past values."
Two modes of range calculation are available in this study: high-low range and average true range.
The study has two plots: RangeRatio and RangeFactor.
"RangeRatio is a histogram that displays the ratio of the current range (high-low range or average true range as defined in the input parameters) to a past value of that range, expressed in percent."
"RangeFactor serves as a reference line; if histogram bars are below this line, range compression may be taking place, in which case the bars are displayed in a different color."
The Accumulation/Distribution strategy uses values of the RangeRatio plot to add simulated buy and sell orders.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The value that is used as both a period of the range calculation and an offset to collect the past value of the range.
` factor ` | Defines the position of the RangeFactor line.
"If a RangeRatio histogram bar is below this line, range compression is recognized."
` mode ` | Defines whether to use the high-low range or the average true range in the calculations.
"## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` RangeRatio ` | The ratio of the current range to its past value, expressed in percent."
` RangeFactor ` | Reference line for the RangeRatio plot.
Histogram bars below this line signal range compression.

"AccumDistPrVol AccumulationSwingIndex reference line; ## Technical Analysis # TrendPersistenceRate ## Description Trend Persistence Rate is a technical indicator designed by Richard Poster, PhD."
"As its name implies, this technical indicator attempts at measuring the strength of a trend."
"While many other indicators assess the trend strength based on price changes, Trend Persistence Rate does so by taking into account trend duration."
Trend Persistence Rate is calculated using the following algorithm: 1.
The system calculates the slope of a moving average as one-bar momentum of that average divided by tick size times a preset multiplier.
2.
The system then counts how many times the slope of a moving average has exceeded the specified threshold and how many times it has fallen below the negative of that threshold over the trend lookup period.
3.
The difference between these two numbers is then divided by the period length and multiplied by 100.
The resulting percentage ratio is the Trend Persistence Rate.
4.
The system also calculates a moving average of that ratio so you can estimate whether the current readings are above or below the mean.
"In the study input parameters, you can customize the output of the indicator based on the trend direction."
"If the ` trend direction ` parameter is set to ` no ` , the output is an absolute value: for both uptrends and downtrends, strength rate is a positive number and higher readings indicate higher strength rates."
"If it is set to ` yes ` , uptrend strength rates are positive numbers and downtrend strength rates are negative."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` average length ` | The length of the moving average to calculate the slope for.
` tpr length ` | The trend strength lookup period.
` tpr average length ` | The length of the moving average of Trend Persistence Rate.
` threshold ` | The threshold (in pips) to compare the moving-average slope with.
` multiplier ` | The tick size multiplier.
` trend direction ` | Defines the value output.
"If set to ` no ` , returns positive values regardless of trend direction."
"If set to ` yes ` , returns positive values for uptrend segments and negative for downtrend ones."
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

"TrendPeriods TrendQuality ## Technical Analysis # TMV ## Description TMV is a system based on technical indicators analyzing trend, momentum, volatility, and volume (TMV)."
"Trend direction is defined using location of price relative to modified Keltner Channels where the middle line is SMA of typical price , and upper and lower lines are based on SMA of High-Low range and represent volatility."
Trend strength is indicated by rising or falling ADX .
"For better understanding of trend direction and strength, price plot is colored using the following algorithm: a bar is painted in an uptick color when its ADX value is higher than the previous one and price is above SMA; downtick color, when ADX is rising and price is below SMA."
"In other cases, bars are colored gray."
"Beside the mentioned indicators, a modified version of Volume Oscillator is calculated."
Its only difference from the standard version is that the result is expressed as a percentage instead of points.
This technical indicator is included in order to predict possible trend reversals: so-called volume spikes (bars having Volume Oscillator values higher than 0.5) often precede major changes in trend.
"For stocks being traded on heavy volume, value of 0.75 is suggested for volume spike determination."
"In order to interpret TMV correctly, it is suggested that you use it with 13 period CCI ."
The main principle of TMV is looking for agreement between the CCI in relation to its zero line and placement of price in relation to Keltner Channels.
"Strong uptrend is often characterized by the following: bars are painted in an uptick color, price is above the upper Keltner Channel, and CCI is positive."
"If a pullback occurs, price might be expected to find support between the upper and lower Keltner channels."
"Conversely, downtick colored bars, price below the lower Keltner channel, and negative CCI suggest strong downtrend conditions."
"In this case, a possible rally is likely to finish between the lower and upper Keltner channels."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used in calculations of SMA.
` keltner length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of Keltner Channels.
` volume fast length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of fast average of Volume Oscillator.

LinearRegCurve LinearRegrIndicator ## Technical Analysis # ExponentialDeviationBands The Exponential Deviation Bands study is a trend-following technical indicator proposed by Vitali Apirine.
"While resembling the Bollinger Bands , this indicator is based on the exponential deviation, not the standard deviation ."
"Three lines, or bands, are calculated: middle band, upper band, and lower band."
"The middle band is, by default, an exponential moving average of close price; you can select a different average type in the input parameters."
"The upper and lower bands are plotted, by default, two exponential deviations above and below the middle band, respectively."
The exponential deviation is defined as exponential average of deviation of close price from its mean.
The resulting indicator is both trend-following and price-lagging because the exponential moving average is used.
"When the bands move upwards, an uptrend may be present."
The bands moving lower may signify a downtrend.
A flat trend may be present when the bands move sideways.
"When the price breaks out of the Exponential Bands, it may signify a start of a new trend."
"When the price pierces the upper band and the upper band has recently started an upturn, an uptrend may be emerging."
Price falling below the lower band that has recently taken a downturn may signify the start of a downtrend.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The length with which averages and exponential deviation are calculated.
"` num dev dn ` | The distance between the middle band and the lower band, in exponential deviations."
"` num dev up ` | The distance between the middle band and the upper band, in exponential deviations."

A buy MIT order is placed below the market; ## Technical Analysis # HACOLT ## Description HACOLT (Heikin Ashi Candles Oscillator Long Term) is a technical indicator designed by Sylvain Vervoort.
"It is based on Sylvain Vervoort's previous indicator, HACO (Heikin-Ashi Candles Oscillator), which was described in his article ""Trading with the Heikin-Ashi Candlestick Oscillator"" for the December 2008 issue of _Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities _ magazine."
"Optimized for long-term trading, HACOLT shows three levels: 0, 50, and 100."
"These levels suggest ""an open short position"", ""no open position"", and ""an open long position"", respectively."
Passing from a certain level to another is viewed as a trading signal: Rising from 0 or 50 to 100 suggests a Long Entry and Short exit; Falling from 100 to 50 or zero suggests a Long Exit; Falling from 100 or 50 to zero indicates a Short Entry.
Main principles of HACOLT include: HACOLT uses zero-lagging TEMA based on modified Heikin Ashi Close prices for data smoothing; Close price higher than its EMA is a Sell signal (represented as falling to zero level); Short candles suggest keeping a position.
"To keep a long position, candle's High should also be greater than or equal to previous Low; to keep a short position, candle's Low should be less than or equal to previous High."
A candle is considered short if its real body is smaller than its High-Low range multiplied by candle size factor.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` tema length ` | The number of bars used to calculate TEMA.
` ema length ` | The number of bars used to calculate EMA.

"If the length of the data set is not specified, the default value is used."
See the following example to learn how the average is calculated.
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | Defines data for which the average is found.
length | 12 | Defines period on which the average value is found.
"## Example 1 script AverageTS { input data = close; input length = 12; plot AverageTS = Sum(data, length) / length; } input price = close; input length = 12; plot SMA1 = Average(price, length); plot SMA2 = AverageTS(price, length); The example plots an average value using the thinkScript implementation called ` AverageTS ` and the built-in function."
Since both the implementations produce the same result the plots coincide with each other forming a single curve.

See also ` GetAggregationPeriod ` function in the Others section.
THIRTY_MIN TWO_HOURS def agg = AggregationPeriod.HOUR; plot data = close(period = agg); ## Technical Analysis # MiddleHighLowMAStrat ## Description The Middle High Low MA (MHL MA) strategy is based on the eponymous study proposed by Vitali Apirine .
The strategy adds simulated orders upon crossovers of a regular and a modified moving average (MA and MHL_MA) calculated by the study.
"The averages share the type and the length, however, the modified moving average is not applied to an OHLC value, but to the price mid-range."
"The mid- range is defined as the arithmetic mean of the highest high and the lowest low, both found on the same lookback period."
"According to the study, the relation between the lookback period and the moving average length is as follows: a lookback period of 3 to 15 bars is suggested for moving averages with length of up to 50; periods of 15 to 50 bars are to be combined with moving averages as slow as 50 to 200 bars in length."
These numbers are referential and can be easily customized in strategy input parameters.
"Based on the behavior of the two averages, the strategy adds simulated orders as follows."
"If MA crosses above MHL_MA, the strategy adds a simulated buy order."
"Conversely, if MA crosses below MHL_MA, a simulated sell order is added."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the length for calculation of both moving averages.
---|--- ` high low length ` | Defines the length of the period upon which the highest high and the lowest low prices are found.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

"This strategy ... with length of up to 50; ## Technical Analysis # Head and Shoulders The Head and Shoulders formation is one of the most famous chart patterns, known for its performance in bullish conditions."
"It appears as a series of three peaks with the middle one being the highest (the ""head"")."
"While the first and the third peaks (the ""shoulders"") need to be lower than the head, it is not required that they are of the same height."
"On the contrary, stats show that patterns where the left shoulder is higher than the right are stronger in post-breakout performance."
"Similarly, the line that connects pattern bottoms, often called ""the neckline"", does not need to be strictly horizontal, necklines with a slope upward tend to be a reinforcing indicator."
"When a Head and Shoulders formation is seen in an uptrend, it signifies a major reversal."
"The strength of this reversal, measured as the decline amount after breakout, is proportional to the rise before pattern emergence: stronger preceding trends are prone to more dramatic reversals."
"Volume is usually the highest at the left shoulder but most likely to deplete by breakout point, although, as one might expect, conditions where the volume is trending up are more favorable."
"Pullbacks occur more often than not, which might somewhat worsen the post- breakout performance."

"These icons will help you utilize, configure, hide gadgets or interfaces or even link them together."
"In this article, we are going to discuss the most frequently used icons."
The Show Actions menu icon is present in almost every thinkorswim gadget and interface.
"Clicking it will bring up the Show Actions menu, which enables you to take some window-related actions, e.g., detach , print , take a screenshot, etc."
"In some interfaces, e.g., Position Summary, it will also prompt you to customize the data to be displayed there."
Detaching portions of the software into dedicated windows is a feature that is commonly used to create more elaborate layouts.
This can be useful for clients who chose to run the software on multiple monitors.
"If this is something you are interested in trying, look for the overlapping squares icon."
"Once clicked, you will see a new window appear with a copy of the section it corresponds to."
You can then move the new window to any monitor you chose.
"When a gadget or an interface is displayed in a separate window, you may want to always display it above all other windows."
"To do so, click the pin button in the top right corner of the detached window."
The gear icon allows you to configure the data you would like to view in a gadget or an interface.
Clicking it will bring up a Customize window where you will be able to configure the set of elements to be displayed.
"For example, clicking this icon in the _Position Statement_ ( Monitor tab) will prompt you to customize the set of columns in the statement."
"In _ Active Trader _ , it can be used to configure the set of buttons above the ladder."
"Note that there is also a small gear button which you will encounter in real-time data tables, e.g., watchlists or Active Trader Ladder."
"Clicking it will bring up a menu, which will prompt you to customize the column set in the table, turn of data sorting, or take some interface-specific actions."
The clip icon brings up a color-and-number selection menu; choosing a color in this menu will link the _Dashboard_ to all thinkorswim components with similar color.
"For example, consider linking a watchlist to a chart: In a watchlist symbol selector, click the clip icon and choose a color from the menu; Repeat this step in the Charts symbol selector, choosing the same color."
"Now that your watchlist is linked to the chart, clicking through the watchlist will automatically display the corresponding symbols in the Charts interface."
### Arrow icons There are several types of arrow icons in thinkorswim; heres a breakdown of what they look like and what they can be used for: Triangle arrows can be used for scrolling through a layout.
Similar arrows in table columns also indicate current sorting; clicking on it will re-sort the table.
Clicking this triangle in a symbol selector will bring up the Symbol Lookup table.
"Open-ended arrows, or ticks, can be respectively used for expanding/collapsing elements."
Click this double triangle arrow to collapse/expand all collapsible elements in the current layout.
Use this control in a Watchlist header to switch between your watchlists in a group.
"Use this control in data tables, e.g., _Trade Activity_ , to display fewer or more columns."
"A small arrow in the bottom right corner of a field indicates that the element can be customized via a drop-down list, which will be brought up once you click it."
"This kind of arrow will enable you to hide some components, e.g., _Left Sidebar_ or _Order Editor_ New thinkorswim Login Window Keyboard Shortcuts and-number selection menu; and choose a color from the menu; ## Technical Analysis # Theta ` Theta ( IDataHolder Underlying Price, IDataHolder Volatility); ` Default values: ` Underlying Price: close(getUnderlyingSymbol()) ` ` Volatility: imp_volatility(getUnderlyingSymbol()) ` ## Description Calculates the theta option greek."

Traders want to know.
Were not out of the woods yet.
Some countries continue to struggle with new COVID case numbers going in the wrong direction.
"But in countries where cases are declining, more people are flying, eating out, anddare we saygoing to the movies."
"Still, others are content to stay comfy at home streaming and zooming."
"After all, who wants to return to the dreaded commute?"
"So, we could see a hybrid reopening/stay-at-home lifestyle become the new normal as we come out of the pandemic."
"In the end, we dont know how this will play out in the markets."
But one thing we do know: The markets will remain unpredictable.
"Some might think an economic recovery would provide a tailwind for the stock markets, but that may already be priced in."
Perhaps interest rates will jump higher or investors may get jittery about higher capital gains taxes.
Everyone knows markets can be irrational and often leave us feeling dejected and emotionally drained.
"Emotions and trading dont get along well, which is why its important for traders to have a calm mind before placing a trade."
The article Four Steps to Finding Your (Trading) Zen on page 16 could help you find a centered approach to tackling the markets.
"And no, its not about taking supplements, eating a healthy diet, or exercising."
Its mindfulness for traders.
"When you recognize what type of trader you are, you can utilize the strategies that fit with your trader personality."
Theres no need to chase every meme stock or cherry-pick every new strategy.
"Focusing on achieving your goals with a clear, focused head will leave you less overwhelmed by all the information thats out there."
Feeding our brains with the right information tends to help us make more rational trading decisions.
"Speaking of rational, many tools could better prepare you for different scenarios the market may throw at you."
"In Risk Profile: The Option Traders Travel Companion on page 20, youll learn how to analyze different whatif scenarios so youre better able to manage risks."
"Things can change more quickly for option traders, so youre going to have to keep an eye on more variables than pricelike time and volatility, for starters."
Well see a lot of changes and new paradigms coming out of the pandemic.
"Be prepared for anything, and more important, be centered and enjoy your summer."

"Referencing Secondary Aggregation So far, we have learned many things about the bars on charts and values which can be calculated for them."
"But we never discussed the way they are formed (or, aggregated)."
"In TOS Charts, three types of aggregation are available: time aggregation, tick aggregation, and range aggregation."
"Time charts represent price action in terms of time: a new bar (or candlestick, line section, etc.)"
is plotted after completion of a certain time period (called aggregation period).
"For example, the 1y D bar chart plots the price action for one year, marking Open, High, Low, and Close prices on the daily basis."
"Tick charts represent intraday price action in terms of quantity of trades: a new bar (or candlestick, line section, etc.)"
is plotted after completion of a certain number of trades (ticks).
This aggregation type can be used on intraday charts with time interval not greater than five days.
"For example, the 2d 133t bar chart plots the price action for two days, defining Open, High, Low, and Close prices every time the number of trades becomes equal to 133."
Range charts represent price action in terms of price accumulation.
"Three modes of range aggregation are available in TOS Charts: Range Bars, Momentum Bars, and Renko Bars."
"However, these are not the subject of this chapter as we are going to discuss time aggregation in thinkScript (information on range charts is available here )."
All scripts we created before were the ones using aggregation period defined in chart settings.
"In order to access data of a different aggregation period in your code, specify the period parameter using the corresponding Aggregation Period constant."
"You can also use a pre-defined string value for this purpose: ` 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, Day, 2 Days, 3 Days, 4 Days, Week, Month, Opt Exp, ` or ` <current period> ` ."
Here is an example script: plot dailyOpen = open(period = AggregationPeriod.DAY); This script plots daily Open price for the current symbol.
"plot weeklyClose = close(""IBM"", period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK); This code plots weekly Close price for IBM."
Interesting thing is that the IBM chart does not have to be opened to plot the Close price: it will be plotted on chart of any symbol you specified in chart settings.
"There is, however, a restriction in terms of time aggregation: secondary aggregation period cannot be less than the primary aggregation period defined by chart settings: plot yesterdayHigh = High(period = AggregationPeriod.DAY)[1]; Designed to plot the High price reached on the previous day, this script will not work on weekly charts."
Another restriction is that two different secondary aggregation periods cannot be used within a single variable: plot Data = close(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH) + close(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK); This script will not work on daily charts.
"In order to make it work, you need to break ` Data ` into two variables: def a = close(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH); def b = close(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK); plot Data = a + b; When referencing secondary aggregation with a variable, keep in mind that if this variable is used in an expression with any of the Fundamental or Date&Time functions with the primary aggregation period, the whole expression will use the latter, not the secondary one."
"E.g., def priClose = close; # primary context def secClose = close(period = AggregationPeriod.DAY); # secondary context def priContext = if GetYYYYMMDD() > 20130101 then secClose else secClose[1]; # primary context due to ""GetYYYYMMDD()"" plot SecondaryAvg = Average(secClose , 12); # secondary context is kept plot PrimaryAvg1 = Average((priClose + secClose) / 2 , 12); # primary context due to ""priClose"" plot PrimaryAvg2 = Average(priContext , 12); # primary context Here, SecondaryAvg is calculated with secondary aggregation period, but both PrimaryAvg1 and PrimaryAvg2 with primary aggregation period."
"Note also that some functions, e.g., ` BodyHeight ` use fundamental data implicitly, therefore, the same algorithm will be applied to expressions with them."
"Expressions that use a variable referencing secondary aggregation and constant values will keep the secondary aggregation period: def secClose10 = 10 + close(period = AggregationPeriod.DAY); # secondary context plot SecondaryAvg = Average(secClose10 , 12); # secondary context is kept The ` SecondaryAvg ` plot will be calculated as a 12 day SMA of the Close price plus 10."
"By now, a lot of thinkScript features have been explained to you."
"We are sure you will have absolutely no problems with reading this script: declare lower; input over_bought = 80; input over_sold = 20; input KPeriod = 10; input DPeriod = 10; input priceH = FundamentalType.HIGH; input priceL = FundamentalType.LOW; input priceC = FundamentalType.CLOSE; input aggregationPeriod = AggregationPeriod.DAY; input slowing_period = 3; input smoothingType = {Default SMA, EMA}; def lowest_k = Lowest(Fundamental(priceL, period = aggregationPeriod), KPeriod); def c1 = Fundamental(priceC, period = aggregationPeriod) - lowest_k; def c2 = Highest(Fundamental(priceH, period = aggregationPeriod), KPeriod) - lowest_k; def FastK = if c2 != 0 then c1 / c2 100 else 0; plot FullK; plot FullD; switch(smoothingType) { case SMA: FullK = Average(FastK, slowing_period); FullD = Average(FullK, DPeriod); case EMA: FullK = ExpAverage(FastK, slowing_period); FullD = ExpAverage(FullK, DPeriod); } plot OverBought = over_bought; plot OverSold = over_sold; This script is based on the Stochastic Full study but price inputs were substituted by ` FundamentalType ` constant input, new ` AggregationPeriod ` constant input was added, and old price input references were replaced with ` Fundamental ` function calls."
This approach can be used to rewrite predefined studies to add support of secondary aggregation period.

"While closely resembling the RSI, its calculation mechanism involves comparing the close price with its exponential moving average instead of its previous value."
"The overall sense of the indicator, though, remains the same: it compares the magnitude of a stock's recent gains to the magnitude of its recent losses on the scale from 0 to 100."
"The Slow RSI plot is accompanied by three reference levels: overbought, oversold, and middle line."
"Default values of these levels are respectively 80, 20, and 50, which, of course, can be adjusted, especially if you use custom parameters for moving average calculations."
"In general, values of the Slow RSI and their behavior in relation to reference levels can help identify price direction, momentum, overbought and oversold conditions, trend strength, and trend direction."
"Statistically, the Slow RSI is said to work better in weaker trends and on longer time frames."
"In strong trends and short-term charts, the classic version of the indicator might be more useful."

"... ## Technical Analysis # SVEHaTypCross ## Description The SVEHaTypCross strategy is a trading system which combines price plot coloring, moving averages, and Buy/Sell triggers."
These three elements are based upon Heikin Ashi values.
Two EMAs (exponential moving averages) are calculated for the system: EMA of typical price and that of average price of Heikin Ashi bars.
These averages form two plots which produce Buy and Sell signals for the strategy.
"A Buy signal is given when the first average crosses above the second at a bullish bar; conversely, a Sell signal is given when the crossover of opposite direction happens at a bearish bar."
These signals also divide the price plot into trending sections: those between consecutive Buy and Sell signals are considered uptrend and colored green while those between consecutive Sell and Buy signals are considered downtrend and colored gray.
The plots and coloring system are added to this strategy in order to facilitate your decision whether to use the default parameters or to adjust them.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` typical length ` | Defines period on which EMA of typical price is calculated.

Formatting Output: Part II Overview Advanced ## How to thinkorswim # CVD Pane The CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) Pane displays the cumulative volume changes based on the volume traded by sell aggressors versus buy aggressors.
"By default, this pane is hidden."
"To make it visible, click on the v-shaped arrow below the ladder."
"By default, two representations of cumulative volume delta are shown: two line plots across the lower chart and two gauges on the right-hand panel."
"Two items are used in each representation because, by default, the split view is enabled (see below)."
This means that the values are shown individually for buy and sell aggressor sides.
"By default, the values are reset daily at the session start time, which you can configure by either right-clicking on the chart and choosing Session start settings or using the configuration window where you can also add more reset points (see below)."
"By comparing the numbers for buyers and sellers, you can determine whether buying or selling pressure is dominant at the moment."
To configure the CVD indicator displayed on the pane: 1\.
Right-click on the indicator and choose Settings .
This will open the configuration window with the active Cumulative Volume Delta tab and settings for the default CVD instance.
2\.
Configure the Order Size Filters settings for the default CVD.
"Here, you can set minimum and maximum volume size to be accounted for in CVD calculation."
3\.
Select the indicator range: Session range : The values are accumulated since the session start time.
Chart range : The values are accumulated over the time period defined by the current chart size.
Note that zooming in and out on the chart may drastically affect the values displayed.
4\.
"Set up points of reset for CVD Values, if necessary."
"Here, you can specify when CVD values are to be reset (they will start accumulating again right after the reset)."
"By default, the values are only reset daily at the session start time."
You can set the session start time by clicking on the Session start settings.
You can also add multiple reset points by clicking on the Add.. button at the bottom of the window.
"In the menu that appears, you can specify the time points at which you want the values to reset and the frequency of resets."
"When added, all reset points are shown in the Reference points area along with their attributes."
"From now on, you can modify your reset points directly in this area using the dropdowns."
You can also remove any of the reset points by clicking on the trash bin icon to the right.
5\.
Deactivate the Split buyers/sellers checkbox if you would like all values to be displayed as a single line plot and a single gauge.
Note that the gauge will display the current dominant pressure side while the line may still contain sections where the different side was dominant.
6\.
"If necessary, customize the colors for the positive (buy side aggressors) and negative (sell side aggressors) values."
7\.
You can immediately reset the values by clicking Reset now.
8\.
"You may want to add another CVD instance, which could be calculated for a different volume size or time range or have a different reset schedule."
"To do so, click on the plus button on top of the window, enter a name for this indicator, and choose colors for positive and negative CVD values."
Click Create .
"Next, configure this new indicator using steps 2-7."
This will show additional line plots on the lower chart and gauge(s) on the right-hand panel.
A new tab will also be added to the top of the configuration window.
Switch between the tabs to configure different instances of CVD.
"To remove a CVD instance, click x on the corresponding tab header."
9\.
"If you add several instances of CVD, you may want to define how they should be displayed on the lower chart."
"To do so, choose one of the options above the CVD instance tabs: Symmetrical ."
"On the lower chart, the range of the Y-axis will have positive and negative parts equal in length to the highest absolute value of any of the active CVD indicators."
"_Example_ : If you add a new instance of CVD and the default CVD currently shows +/-400 for the dominant side while the secondary CVD shows +/-200 for the dominant side, the Y-axis will be scaled so that it contains both +400 and -400 marks."
Include 0 .
"On the lower chart, the Y-axis will be scaled so that it always contains the zero mark, regardless of the values of the CVD indicators."
Compact.
"On the lower chart, the Y-axis will be scaled so it contains all the current values of CVD indicators in the most compact way possible."
"When youve finished configuring your CVD indicators, you can customize their display on the right-hand panel: 1\."
"To change the style of indication, right-click on the panel, navigate to Widgets style , and choose any of the following: Vertical bars , Horizontal bars , or Text ."
Circles (gauges) are the default option.
2\.
"To change the position of any of the indicators, right-click on it and choose either Move left or Move right ."
Repeat until the indicators are displayed in the desirable order.
Imbalance Indicators ## Technical Analysis # Regression Channel ## Description Regression channel consists of two parallel lines plotted equidistantly above and below the Regression Line .

## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- Underlying Price | close(getUnderlyingSymbol()) | Defines price to be used in calculation of delta.
Volatility | imp_volatility(getUnderlyingSymbol()) | Defines volatility to be used in calculation of delta.
## Example declare lower; def epsilon = 0.01 close(GetUnderlyingSymbol()); plot approxDelta = (OptionPrice(underlyingPrice = close(GetUnderlyingSymbol()) + epsilon) - OptionPrice()) / epsilon; plot Delta = Delta(); This example illustrates the approximate calculation of delta by dividing a change in the theoretical option price by a change in the underlying symbol price.
Gamma declare lower; def epsilon = 0.01 * close(GetUnderlyingSymbol()); plot approxDelta = (OptionPrice(underlyingPrice = close(GetUnderlyingSymbol()) + epsilon) - OptionPrice()) / epsilon; plot Delta = Delta(); ## Technical Analysis # Andrews' Pitchfork ## Description Andrews' Pitchfork is a channel-based analysis technique developed by Alan Andrews.
"It is plotted using three points, each marking an important pivot point."
"It is suggested that one of the following schemes be used: in an uptrend, trough-peak-trough; in a downtrend - peak-trough-peak."
"First two points define the trendline, last two points define the channel."
"After the last two points are connected, the channel is completed, and the median line is added, the plot indeed resembles a fork."
"The main rule of using Andrews' Pitchfork is the same as for the channel: in the uptrend, the upper channel line might serve as resistance, while in downtrend, the lower line might be used as a potential support level."
"The handle (median line) shows the strength of the trend: in strong uptrend conditions, price tends to be above the median line while in strong downtrend, below."
Andrews' Pitchfork can be transformed into Schiff and modified Schiff Pitchfork.
Schiff Pitchfork moves the start point of the handle line halfway to the base of the channel.
Modified Schiff Pitchfork adjusts the handle start point by the distance equal to half a difference between price values of base points of the channel.
"In order to add the Andrews' Pitchfork to chart, choose it from the Active Tool menu."
Specify begin and end points of the trendline and then specify the third point which will set the channel width; the channel will develop automatically.

"Unlike the regular Momentum ... SchaffTrendCycle The Schaff Trend Cycle (STC) is a technical indicator developed by Doug Schaff as an improvement ... SlowRSI The Slow Relative Strength Index is a version of the classic Relative Strength Index (RSI), ... ## How to thinkorswim # Composite Symbols A _composite symbol_ is defined by a mathematical expression where other symbols are used as variables (components)."
Only two mathematical operations are available between the components: addition and subtraction.
"Thus, a two- component composite symbol may look like ` AAA+BBB ` or ` AAABBB ` ."
You are free to use as many components as you like.
"Also, numerical coefficients are allowed; use an asterisk or a slash to add coefficients to the symbols: ` AAA+2BBB3CCC ` or ` AAA/2+3BBB ` ."
Brackets are allowed and have the same sense as in algebra: ` (AAA+BBB)/3-2CCC ` .
"Just like regular symbols, the composite ones have OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) values; however, these values are calculated based on OHLCV of the symbols used in the expression, their coefficients, and the aggregation period."
The calculation is performed as follows: 1.
The system registers OHLCV values for each of the components on each of the periods defined by the aggregation.
2.
Each value is multiplied by the corresponding coefficient (if any).
Note: composite volume value is an exception and is calculated by dividing the symbol's volume by the corresponding coefficient.
3.
The composite OHLCV values are derived based on the algorithm described in the table below | Comp.
Open | Comp.
High | Comp.
Low | Comp.
"Close | Comp.Volume ---|---|---|---|---|--- ` AAA+BBB ` | Open A +Open B | High A +High B | Low A +Low B | Close A +Close B | Min(Vol A ,Vol B ) ` AAA-BBB ` | Open A -Open B | High A -Low B | Low A -High B | Close A -Close B | Min(Vol A ,Vol B ) Note that a composite high price of the difference is equal to the first symbols high minus second symbols low; composite low is the first symbols low minus second symbols high."
The composite volume of both the sum and the difference is equal to whichever volume of the two components is less.
Note also that composite symbols are not available on tick charts and the concept of aggregation is crucial for them.
Its not unlikely that daily high and low of each component are reached at different periods throughout the day.
"Thus, the composite OHLCV values may change dramatically as you edit the timeframe."

"The Unique Three River Bottom candlestick pattern is recognized if: The first candle is long and bearish and continues the downtrend; The second candle is bearish, has a long lower shadow and its body is completely inside the previous candle's body; The second candle's Low price is less than that of the first candle; The third candle is small and bullish, its Close price is lower than that of the second candle."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of candles used to calculate the average body height.
"If the body height of a candle exceeds this average, it is considered long."
` trend setup ` | The number of preceding candles to check if the trend exists.
` body factor ` | The factor used when checking if a candle is short.
A candle is considered short if its body height is less than the average multiplied by this factor.

"RangeBands RateOfChange is said to be ""out of balance"" and the Range Indicator values are high; # Release notes for April 22, 2023 ## Technical Analysis # fold ## Syntax ` def <result> = fold <index> = <start> to <end> [ with <variable> [ = <init> ] ] [ while <condition> ] do <expression>; ` ## Description The ` fold ` operator allows you to perform iterated calculations."
The list below explains the operator's logic (variable names are taken from the sample syntax above): 1\.
The purpose of the ` fold ` operator is to perform an iterated calculation and assign the final value to the ` result ` variable.
2\.
The ` index ` variable serves as a loop counter.
3\.
"With each iteration, the ` index ` value increases by ` 1 ` ; the initial value of ` index ` is set by the ` start ` parameter."
4\.
Iterated calculations will be performed while the ` index ` value is less than the ` end ` parameter.
"Once the ` index ` value becomes equal to the ` end ` parameter, the loop is terminated without calculation."
5\.
"Within each iteration, the operator calculates the ` expression ` and assigns the result to the ` variable ` ."
"In the ` expression ` , you are free to use the value of ` index ` and also reference the previous value of the ` variable ` ."
` ` The initial value of the ` variable ` can be specified with the ` init ` parameter.
"If none is specified, then the ` variable ` is assigned a value of ` 0 ` before the first iteration."
6\.
"The ` variable ` value is thus re-written after each iteration; after the last iteration, its final value is assigned to the ` result ` variable."
7\.
You can also add a condition within the ` while ` block of the operator.
"If this condition is violated, the ` resul ` ` t ` is assigned the last known value of ` variable ` and the loop is terminated."
## Example 1 input n = 10; plot factorial = fold index = 1 to n + 1 with p = 1 do p index; This example script calculates the factorial of a number.
"Here, the ` factorial ` variable stores the result value of the calculation; ` index ` is the counter and its values are increased by ` 1 ` from ` 1 ` through ` n+1 ` ."
The ` p ` is the variable whose value is re-written over iterations; its initial value is set to ` 1 ` .
The expression is the product of ` p ` and ` index ` .
"After the first iteration, ` p ` is ` 11=1 ` ."
"After the second iteration, it is equal to its current value ( ` 1 ` ) multiplied by current ` index ` ( ` 2 ` ), i.e., ` 2 ` ."
"After the third iteration, its current value ( ` 2 ` ) is multiplied by current ` index ` ( ` 3 ` ), yielding ` 6 ` ."
"Since the input ` n ` is set to ` 10 ` , there will be 10 iterations (the loop is terminated when the ` index ` becomes equal to ` n+1=11 ` ), so the last value of ` p ` will be equal to ` 3,628,800 ` (a product of all numbers from 1 through 10)."
This is the value that is assigned to the ` factorial ` variable after the loop is complete.
"## Example 2 input price = close; input length = 9; plot SMA = (fold n = 0 to length with s do s + getValue(price, n, length - 1)) / length; This example script calculates a simple moving average using ` fold ` ."
"## Example 3 plot NextHigh = fold i = 0 to 100 with price = Double.NaN while IsNaN(price) do if getValue(high, -i, -99) > 40 then getValue(high, -i, -99) else Double.NaN; This example script plots the closest high price value greater than 40 out of the next 100 bars."

"Considering the input-defined aggregation period, the Volume Profile plots a histogram showing price distribution, revealing the dominant price values in terms of volume."
The width of histogram's row represents the number of actual transactions made within the price interval defined by the row's height.
The longest row of the Volume Profile defines the price level at which the highest number of real transactions were made during the specified time period; this level is called Point Of Control (POC).
"If there are several equally long rows that fit this description, the system chooses the closest to the price mid-range."
"Should the rows be equidistant from the mid-range, the system recognizes the lower one as the Point Of Control."
"By default, the price range surrounding the POC level where 70% of the trading activity took place for the specified time period is Value Area (note that the percentage is customizable within the ""value area percent"" input parameter)."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price per row height mode ` | Defines the height setting mode for each row of the histogram.
"""AUTOMATIC"" splits the trading range of the whole chart into 85 equal intervals."

"` custom row height ` | Defines the price interval to set the height of rows when ""CUSTOM"" mode is selected within the ""price per row height mode"" input."
` time per profile ` | Defines time interval to compile the volume data for the histogram.
"Setting this parameter to ""CHART"" involves the entire price plot into calculation."
"Values ""BAR"", ""MINUTE"", ""HOUR"", ""DAY"", ""WEEK"", ""MONTH"", and ""OPT EXP"" allow you to set aggregation manually, specifying number of these periods within the ""multiplier"" input."
` multiplier ` | Defines the number of periods to calculate the Volume Profile.
"Note that this setting is ignored if ` time per profile ` input is set to ""CHART""."
` on expansion ` | Defines whether or not the profile is shown on the expansion area of the chart.
"For more information on the subgraph expansion, refer to the Time Axis Settings article."
"` profiles ` | Defines the number of profiles to be displayed if ""on expansion"" input is set to ""No""."
"If ""on expansion"" input is set to ""Yes"" then ""profiles"" setting is ignored and only one profile is shown."
` show point of control ` | Defines whether or not to highlight the histogram row containing the POC price level.
` show value area ` | Defines whether or not to highlight the Value Area.
` value area percent ` | Defines the percentage of the trading activity for which the Value Area is determined.

Condition Wizard Condition Wizard is a special feature which allows you to build up conditions or logical ... ## How to thinkorswim # Time Charts Time charts are probably the most popular chart type in terms of aggregation as the algorithm of plotting these is quite obvious.
"On time charts, a new bar (or candlestick, line section, etc.)"
is plotted after completion of a certain time period (called aggregation period).
"For example, a chart with an aggregation of 1 day displays bars that represent daily high, low, open, and close values."
"On the volume subgraph, daily volume values are displayed."
Another period by which the time charts are characterized is called chart period: it determines the time span for which the entire chart is plotted.
"For example, a 1y D chart visualizes the price action for one year, marking open, high, low, and close prices on the daily basis."
"This 1y D notation is what we refer to as chart time frame; to learn how you can set up a time frime, refer to this article ."

"name | Color.MAGENTA | Defines the order name which will be displayed on ""Orders"" tabs in strategy settings, in strategy report, and as captions to the Buy/Sell signal arrows on chart."
"By default, all orders use the same name as the strategy itself."
"## Example AddOrder(OrderType.BUY_AUTO, close > close[1], open[-1], 50, Color.ORANGE, Color.ORANGE, ""Sample buy @ "" + open[-1]); If the current Close price is higher than the previous, the code opens the long position or closes the short one at the Open price of the next bar."
"The trade size will be equal to 50, signals will be colored orange, and each signal will display the buying price."
Alert ## Technical Analysis # SentimentZoneOscillator ## Description The Sentiment Zone Oscillator (SZO) is a technical indicator which attempts to measure overall market sentiment (bullish or bearish) and marks overbought and oversold levels.
Calculation of this indicator is based on a premise that extremely bullish or bearish tendencies will eventually lead to trend reversal.
"In order to calculate the main plot, SZO finds the TEMA-smoothed sum of ""up"" bars minus sum of ""down"" bars on the specified period."
"An ""up"" bar has the price higher than that of the previous bar; a ""down"" bar, lower."
The average is then multiplied by 100 and divided by the length of the period.
The main plot is accompanied with dynamic overbought and oversold levels.
"In order to calculate these lines, the highest and lowest values of SZO, as well as its range, are found on a long-length period."
Overbought line is placed above the lowest value at a distance equal to the specified percentage of the SZO range.
Oversold line is placed below the highest value at the same distance.
"As SZO reaches new extremes, overbought and oversold lines are plotted at new levels."
"For information on Buy and Sell signals produced by the study, refer to the article on the Sentiment Zone strategy which adds Buy and Sell orders once these signals occur."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used in main plot calculation.
` length ` | The number of bars used in main plot calculation.
` long length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of overbought and oversold levels.
` percent ` | The percentage used in calculation of overbought and oversold levels.

It is based on a premise that macroeconomic sectors behave differently in certain phases of uptrend and downtrend.
"This behavior was described by Giorgos E. Siligardos in his article ""Applying the Sector Rotation Model"" with eight sectors being taken into account: financials, discretionary, industrials, raw materials, energy, staples, health care, and utilities."
Financials and discretionary are believed to lead the emerging bullish market and industrials take the leadership once the bullish trend is established.
"Raw materials and energy outperform other sectors at the end of trend while staples, health care, and utilities are the top performers in the downtrend."
"In order to implement these rules, Sector Rotation Model uses the following indexes: XLY for consumer discretionary, XLF for financials, XLE for energy, XLP for staples, and XLU for utilities."
"For each of these, the rate of change of the Close price is found."
"The bullish component is then equal to the sum of values calculated for XLY and XLF, divided by two, and the bearish component is equal to the sum of values calculated for XLE, XLU, and XLP, divided by three."
The resulting plot is the difference between the bullish and bearish components multiplied by 100.
"Parts of plot above the zero line are colored green which signifies uptrend, and those below zero colored red which conforms to downtrend conditions."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars with which the rates of change are calculated.

"By default, the momentum is calculated as the difference between the latest close price and the close price 12 bars prior to it."
Both the price type and the offset period are customizable.
The momentum indicator is often analyzed based on its crossovers with the zero level.
Crossing above the zero line and further rising may signify uptrend acceleration while reversal to zero could mean that the trend is decelerating.
"Conversely, momentum values falling below zero might be regarded as a sign of downtrend emergence, with downtrend getting stronger as indicator values continue to drop."

The strategy adds a buy to ... ## Technical Analysis # EhlersSimpleDecycler ## Description The Ehlers Simple Decycler study is a virtually zero-lag technical indicator proposed by John F. Ehlers.
The original idea behind this study (and several others created by John F. Ehlers) is that market data can be considered a continuum of cycle periods with different cycle amplitudes.
"Thus, trending periods can be considered segments of longer cycles, or, in other words, low- frequency segments."
Applying the right filter might help identifying these segments.
The main principle of the simple decycler is subtracting the high-pass filter output from the price data input.
"This eliminates high-frequency components from the price data, while the low-frequency ones, i.e., trends, are kept intact."
"Given that high-pass filters are virtually lag-free, the simple decycler outputs the low-frequency components with little to no lag."
The main plot of the Ehlers Simple Decycler study is accompanied by two lines that are plus and minus 0.5 percent from it by default.
These lines form a so- called hysteresis band which might prove helpful in trend identification.
"Theoretically, prices that are above the upper hysteresis line are in uptrend and, vice versa, those below the lower line are in downtrend."
Prices within the hysteresis band are believed to be trend-neutral.
## Input Parameters ` price ` | Defines the price on which the calculations are performed.
---|--- ` roof cutoff length ` | Defines the maximum cycle length in bars.
Cycles with greater lengths will be eliminated.

"Data derived from the Stress Indicator is adapted for hedging and expanded with several safety techniques, such as stop- loss and minimum price."
"In addition to adding standard simulated buy and sell orders, the Stress strategy marks time points where hedging the instrument with an index could be or could have been useful."
It also calculates the hypothetical hedging size for these points.
Simulated Trade Orders An initial simulated buy order is added when the Stress Indicator falls below the specified entry level and the index is in uptrend.
"After an exit, the simulated buy order is only added when the Stress Indicator falls below the entry level from above 50."
The simulated sell order is added when any of the following conditions are true: Stress Indicator goes above the exit level; Decline in price from the entry point exceeds the stop-loss percentage value; Price falls below the minimum level at least once during the specified ` min price length ` period.
Hedging Hedging is treated by the strategy as an independent process solely based on the trend of the chosen index.
"When index is in downtrend, the strategy indicates that hedging could be useful and calculates the hypothetical hedge size."
"Here, the downtrend is identified when the average close price of the index falls."
"The hedging size (i.e., the trading of the index) is calculated as hedge ratio times stock position times stock to index volatility ratio."
Both stock volatility and index volatility are calculated using the standard deviation formula.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` index ` | Defines the index to be used in hedging with the specified stock.
` length ` | The period upon which the highest and the lowest prices of both the index and the stock are found; used in stochastic calculation.
` investment ` | Defines hypothetical investment for simulated buy orders.

` entry level ` | Defines the entry level for the simulated buy condition.
` exit level ` | Defines the exit level for the first simulated sell condition.
` stop loss ` | Defines the critical percentage of the price decline from the entry point; used in the second simulated sell condition.
` min price ` | Defines the critical percentage of the price decline from the entry point; used in the third simulated sell condition.
` min price length ` | Defines the period for the third simulated sell condition.
` hedge length ` | Defines the period for calculation of standard deviations and average close price of the index.
` hedge ratio ` | Defines the ratio of the hedge-protected position size to the size of the entire position; used in the index trade size calculation.

# FAQ - Portfolio Margin 1-10 Contacts Portfolio Margin Portfolio Margin Price Methodology Under the Hood of Portfolio Margin Portfolio Margin Leverage Eligible PM Participants Portfolio Margin Eligible and Default to Regulation T Margin Portfolio Margin Non-Eligible Portfolio Margin Calls Additional Portfolio Margin House Rules 11-13 PM Low Price and Low Liquidity Eligibility Real-time Risk Monitoring Disclaimer ## Contacts Portfolio Margin Learning Center Portfolio Margin Specialists 877-877-0272 Ext 2 ## Portfolio Margin Portfolio Margin (PM) is a risk-based methodology used for the computation of risk on eligible stock and option margin requirements for qualifying accounts.
PM requirements are based on one day theoretical loss from individual positions instead of the fixed percentages inherent within traditional Regulation T margin requirements.
Portfolio Margin is calculated by using theoretical option pricing models to determine potential real-time losses at various price points for each position.
The maximum expected single day loss from these price moves are then aggregated to determine the overall margin requirements for the portfolio.
The PM approach allows an investor to have improved transparency and alignment between margin requirements and the overall risk of the portfolio.
This will often result in lower margin requirements than the standard requirements compared to a Regulation T margin account.
"## Portfolio Margin Price Methodology As highlighted above, PM is calculated using various price point movements to determine potential real-time losses."
"Because there are different expected price changes dependent on the characteristics of the underlying positions, the percentage tests will reflect those differences, as following: Individual stock and option positions are tested with +/- 15% price changes."
Large capitalization broad-based indices and Small capitalization broad-based indices are tested with -12%+10% price changes.
"Concentrated positions will be evaluated using a greater percentage price move set by TD Ameritrade due to excess leverage in a single underlying, resulting in a higher requirement than a non-concentrated position."
"The total range is then divided into ten equidistant points, and the loss/gain on the position as a whole is calculated at each of the ten points (scenarios)."
Stress testing is done on a positions implied volatility and the margin requirement will be the largest loss calculated on any given scenario.
"Because the largest loss is the margin requirement, a hedged position (defined risk) will have a lower requirement than a position that is unhedged."
## Under the Hood of Portfolio Margin The Firm utilizes a Theoretical Intermarket Margining System (TIMS) developed by the Option Clearing Corporation as well as a proprietary model similar to TIMS which uses two independent volatility calculations.
Sticky Strike and Adjusted Sticky Delta are used to calculate the largest theoretical loss of either curve to determine specific real-time Portfolio Margin requirements.
TD Ameritrade Clearing (TDAC) uses two methods to dynamically incorporate IV(implied volatility) into the risk array: 1.
Sticky Strike (Constant IV) Each option strike uses its constant IV in the option pricing model to calculate theoretical option prices at each evaluation point of the risk array 2.
Adjusted Sticky Delta (IV with Slope) The IV is based on the moneyness (e.g.
"in the money, at the money, out of the money) of an option with respect to the evaluation point."
We assign a slope and adjusted volatility to each price point.
"Of the two methods used, the risk array yielding the highest theoretical loss is applied for the margin requirement Product group offsets may be allowed in certain instances where there are high underlying correlations on product groups as determined by the Option Clearing Group (OCC), resulting in PM requirement relief."
"## Portfolio Margin Leverage As referenced above, position concentrations are evaluated differently based on the different risk profile of these positions."
We determine the requirements for concentration as follows: Proprietary Concentration Logic An Expected Price Range (EPR) represents the Firms current best estimate of the price change of a given security over a one-day period.
It is expressed in percentage terms of the current security price and is composed of a lower and upper bound.
(e.g.
"percentage up and percentage down) Estimated for each security based on five years of historical price data, if available TD Ameritrades experienced Risk Managers actively monitor EPRs and may adjust where necessary based upon the current market environment."
"Example factors include, but are not limited to: Implied volatility Upcoming announcements (Earnings, product release, FDA decision, etc.)"
"Point of No Return (PNR) for Concentration The definition of PNR is the percentage move in a securitys price where the account would theoretically lose 100% of its net liquidation value, that is, when the account net liquidation value would be zero."
"Risk Array Expected Price Range (EPR) vs. Point of No Return (PNR) If a PNR is outside or greater than the EPR, then the risk array will default to the house percentages, generally +/-15% for equities and +10%/-12% for equity based indices."
"If a PNR is inside or less than the EPR, the higher EPR percentage is used for the array."
"## Eligible PM Participants Full option approval Must have $125,000 of net liquidating value and must always maintain $100,000 Must have advanced features enabled Available only to margin (non-IRA) accounts Smaller accounts cannot be combined to meet the 125k requirements Regulatory portfolio margin minimum of 100k ## Portfolio Margin Eligible and Default to Regulation T Margin Each of the following is subject to FINRA Rule 4210 Margin Requirements and calculated using regular strategy based margin: Non-Standard options that result from Corporate actions (spin-offs, splits, etc.)"
"Fixed Income Exchange traded notes (ETNs) Warrants Securities deemed ineligible by TD Ameritrade Risk Management ## Portfolio Margin Non-Eligible OTC (bulletin board) and other non-marginable securities Future positions are not permitted to be included in Portfolio Margin for purposes of determining margin requirements of product groups as an offset because of separate jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ## Portfolio Margin Calls There are two types of Portfolio Margin calls: Portfolio Margin (""P"") Call Liquidating Value (""L"") Call TD Ameritrade Margin Risk Specialists independently verify the validity of all margin calls and will communicate to the client his/her obligation to meet the margin call."
The client is required to take action within a specific timeframe depending on the category of the margin call.
Portfolio Margin calls (P) must be met within Trade Date + 2 days (T+2) and Portfolio Margin Liquidating Value calls (L) must be met within T+10 days.
"However, TD Ameritrade reserves the right to institute a shorter time frame, including same day, for any call to be satisfied depending on market conditions."
"Additional details on the types of Portfolio Margin Calls: L Call - Accounts must always maintain a minimum net liquidating value of $100,000."
"If an account falls below the $100,000 level, a ""L Call"" will be issued on the next business day and the account is restricted to risk reducing trades only."
"The customer depending on account equity and market volatility may have until (T+10) to increase the end of day balance above $100,000 to be re-enabled to initiate opening trades."
P Call A P Call is created when the total margin requirement exceeds the net liquidating value at the end of the business day.
The margin call is issued on the next business day and the account is restricted to risk reducing trades on the due date.
"In this case, the client has until the end of the due date to either close positions or deposit/transfer in funds."
Failure to meet the margin call may result in a liquidation.
"Portfolio Margin calls greater than 50% equity may be issued as due in T+1, earlier than the standard T+2."
"TD Ameritrade reserves the right to issue a Portfolio margin call due immediately based on market volatility ,low equity and large margin call deficiencies."
No opening positions are permitted until a P Call or L Call is satisfied.
PM clients may only trade out of a P Call three times per rolling 12 - month period unless the margin call is due solely to market activity in which case the account may be liquidated without penalty.
TDAC reserves the right to remove PM status from an account at any time.
The Margin Risk team will contact the client of any such notification.

Studies are technical indicators that calculate certain values for each bar on chart.
"Strategies, on the other hand, also provide you with historical trade signals: time and price points on chart where a certain price-based condition was satisfied."
Strategies can also be back-tested: you can view a report that calculates the hypothetical profit/loss value that could have been actual if the signals given by the strategy were real buy and sell orders.

Defining Inputs In this chapter we will discuss how to make your study more flexible.
"Most of the built-in studies are adjustable in terms of timeframe, price data, or mode of calculation to employ."
It is only a matter of seconds to switch from a larger timeframe to a shorter one using input parameters which will appear in your Edit Studies and Strategies dialog window if you properly use reserved word ` input ` in the beginning of the script.
Lets see how it works.
"In chapter 2 , the following script was discussed: def val = close/open; def data1 = Exp(val); def data2 = Power(Double.E, val); Now that you know that the variables ` data1 ` and ` data2 ` will yield identical values, lets exclude the latter from the script: def val = close/open; def data1 = Exp(val); Here is the question: what if you dont need the Close to Open ratio anymore but need the inverse one?"
What if you dont need this one either and want the High to Low ratio instead?
"Here is the best way to do it: input val1 = close; input val2 = open; def data = Exp (val1/val2); Once added, this script will provide the same results as the above mentioned would."
"But this one is much better: whenever you need to change the ratio, you could go to the Edit Studies and Strategies dialog window and build this ratio directly in it."
"In order to do that, specify the fundamentals for ` val1 ` and ` val2 ` and click Apply ; the script will be recalculated."
"You are not restricted to only using the price data for inputs: thinkScript provides you with numerous types of inputs, automatically deciding which type it would be based on the default value specified by you (this is what you type after the equals sign in the input declaration row)."
Integer inputs will allow you to enter another integer with which the calculation will be performed.
"input length = 10; plot SMA = Average(close, length); This will calculate a 10 period SMA of close price (if you are not sure what it is, next chapter will explain everything) with an option to change its length via the corresponding input."
"And, of course, we could make it even more flexible: input length = 10; input price = close; plot SMA = Average(price, length); Now both price and length can be adjusted."
"Floating numbers can also be used for inputs, however, be careful as there are types of data for which only integers can be used, e.g., number of bars."
"In order to tell thinkScript that you need a floating number, use a period in the default value: input percentShift = 10.0; plot UpperBand = close (1 + percentShift / 100); plot LowerBand = close (1 - percentShift / 100); This script will draw an envelope based on the Close price."
"In this envelope, bands will be shifted up and down from the close price by 10 percent, although you are free to specify any percentage you need: 25.5, 47.8, 99.9, etc."
"Using a string input can be especially useful when you need a quick change of symbol for which some value is calculated: input symbol = ""SPX""; plot Comparison = close(symbol); This plot draws the Close price of the specified symbol which is set to SPX by default."
Note that string inputs are defined using values in quotes.
Symbols are not the only application of string inputs as this type of input can be used for any function that accepts string values as input parameters.
"Boolean inputs can quickly help you select a certain calculation mode out of two defined in the script: to define a Boolean input, use ` yes ` or ` no ` as the default value: input useHighLow = yes; plot HighPrice = if useHighLow then Highest(high, 10) else Highest(close, 10); plot LowPrice = if useHighLow then Lowest(low, 10) else Lowest(close, 10); This script will plot a channel based on the highest High and lowest Low price on the period of 10 bars if the input is set to ` yes ` ."
"If this input is set to ` no ` , channel we be plotted based on the highest and lowest Close price."
Note that we use an explicit condition in this script: it starts with word ` if ` and tests if we chose ` yes ` or ` no ` as the input value.
Using conditional expressions will be discussed in chapter 6 .
"If you need more than two options to select from or if you prefer more meaningful naming for them, the ` enum ` type should be used."
"This will require just a little bit more scripting, but its not too difficult."
"First of all, list all the options for the input in braces and specify the default one: input fastLength = 14; input slowLength = 28; input diffType = {default points, percent}; After that, you will need to specify what should happen if a certain option is selected."
"This is done by using commands ` switch ` and ` case ` : input fastLength = 14; input slowLength = 28; input diffType = {default points, percent}; plot VolumeOsc; switch (diffType) { case points: VolumeOsc = Average(volume, fastLength) - Average(volume, slowLength); case percent: VolumeOsc = (Average(volume, fastLength) - Average(volume, slowLength)) / Average(volume, slowLength); } This example script plots the volume oscillator, a difference between two simple moving averages (SMAs) of volume with different lengths."
"Here, command ` switch ` defines whether the oscillator should be plotted as the difference itself ( ` case ` points) or as its percent ratio to the slower moving average ( ` case ` percent)."
"Speaking of the averages, if you wonder what these words and abbreviations stand for, move on to next chapter where we are going to discuss several ways of averaging data in thinkScript."

"Using Averages def val = close/open; def data1 = Exp(val); def data2 = Power(Double.E, val); def val = close/open; def data1 = Exp(val); input val1 = close; input val2 = open; def data = Exp (val1/val2); and click **Apply** ; input length = 10; plot SMA = Average(close, length); input length = 10; input price = close; plot SMA = Average(price, length); input percentShift = 10.0; plot UpperBand = close * (1 + percentShift / 100); plot LowerBand = close * (1 - percentShift / 100); input symbol = ""SPX""; plot Comparison = close(symbol); input useHighLow = yes; plot HighPrice = if useHighLow then Highest(high, 10) else Highest(close, 10); plot LowPrice = if useHighLow then Lowest(low, 10) else Lowest(close, 10); input fastLength = 14; input slowLength = 28; input diffType = {default points, percent}; input fastLength = 14; input slowLength = 28; input diffType = {default points, percent}; plot VolumeOsc; ## Technical Analysis # BAR ## Syntax ` ChartType.BAR ` ## Description Used in SetChartType function to set the Bar chart type."

## What is a Margin Account?
A margin account permits investors to borrow funds from their brokerage firm to purchase marginable securities on credit and to borrow against marginable securities already in the account.
Interest is charged on the borrowed funds for the period of time that the loan is outstanding.
"Accounts with a minimum value of $2000 are eligible for margin with the exception of: Uniform Gifts to Minors Account (UGMA) Coverdell (Education Savings Account) Minor IRA Guardian/Conservator account Estate account Accounts managed by TD Ameritrade Investment Management In addition, an IRA or qualified plan account approved for margin: Will not be permitted to borrow funds Will not be able to have a debit balance May not short stock or sell uncovered options Note: Some foreign accounts in specific countries are not able to add margin privileges."
## How do I apply for margin?
"To apply for margin trading, log in to your account at www.tdameritrade.com , go to Client Services > My Profile and select General ."
"In the Elections & routing section, select Apply next to Margin trading ."
You will be asked to complete three steps: 1.
Read the Margin Risk Disclosure statement.
2.
Enter your personal information.
3.
Agree to the terms.
"Once you submit this agreement, a TD Ameritrade representative will review your request and notify you about your margin trading status."
## How does my margin account work?
"Generally, a client pledges the securities in their account as collateral for a loan that they may then use to purchase additional securities."
The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) sets margin requirements for various marginable securities.
"For instance, the current margin requirement for initial purchase of eligible securities is 50% of the purchase amount."
This is commonly referred to as the Regulation T (Reg T) requirement.
"Under Reg T, you must have at least 50% of the value of the trade in your account in either cash or fully paid marginable securities by settlement date of the trade."
"Although, The Federal Reserve determines which stocks can be used as collateral for margin loans, TD Ameritrade is not obligated to extend margin on all approved stocks."
"As an example, a client with $10,000 of cash in a margin account would be able to purchase up to $20,000 worth of marginable securities, this is known as a clients Stock Buying Power."
## How is Buying Power Determined?
"The calculation of stock buying power is the lesser of Special Memorandum Account (SMA) multiplied by two or maintenance excess divided by 30%, unless the security has special margin requirements."
## What is SMA?
"The Special Memorandum Account (SMA), is a line of credit that is created when the market value of securities held in a Regulation T margin account appreciate."
The objective of this account is to maintain the buying power that unrealized gains create towards future purchases without creating unnecessary funding transactions.
"Without SMA, an account would have to withdraw excess equity and redeposit it at the time of the accounts next purchase."
## How does SMA change?
"The SMA account increases as the value of the securities in the account appreciate, but does not decrease when the value of those securities depreciates."
"However, SMA can only appreciate when accounts equity percentage is 50% or greater."
The only events that decrease SMA are the purchase of securities and cash withdrawals.
Below is a list of events that will impact your SMA: Positive Adjustments to SMA | Effect ---|--- Cash Deposit | 100% of Value Marginable Security Deposits | 50% of Value Cash Dividend or Interest Credit | 100% of Value Sale of Long Marginable Securities | 50% of Value Sale of Long Non-Marginable Securities | 100% of Value Buy-to-Cover Short Equity Position | 50% of the Value Premium Collected from Selling an Option (Opening or Closing) | 100% of the Value Appreciation of Marginable Securities when Reg-T excess is available | 50% of the Value Negative Adjustments to SMA | Effect ---|--- Cash Withdrawal | 100% of Value Purchase of Marginable Securities | 50% of Value Purchase of Non-Marginable Securities | 100% of Value Buying Options (Premium Paid) | 100% of Value Transfer Out of Marginable Securities | 50% of Value _Margin Interest and appreciation/depreciation of non-marginable securities do not have any impact on SMA._ ## What is Maintenance Excess?
"Maintenance excess, also known as house surplus, is the amount by which your margin equity exceeds the total maintenance requirements for all positions held in your account."
Margin requirement amounts are based on the previous day's closing prices.
Maintenance excess applies only to accounts enabled for margin trading.
"If applicable, you can view this figure under ""Margin equity"" in the ""Margin"" section on the displayed page."

"Example Client has the following buying power available: Funds Available for Trading | Stock Buying Power ---|--- $16,3000 | $54,333.33 Client wishes to purchase the maximum amount of ABC Corp. ABC Corp has a 30% margin requirement."

"The client decides not to purchase ABC, but would rather own XYZ which has a 40% margin requirement."
"$16300/40% = $40,750 In this case, the same client, would only be able to purchase $40,750 of XYZ due to its 40% requirement."

## How do I meet my margin call?
"Deposit the original call amount Liquidate securities so that your account would be positive based on the closing prices of the normal market session Deposit fully paid-for marginable securities Or any combination of the aforementioned ways ## I have multiple margin calls in my account, can I just liquidate enough to meet the first margin call?"
"No, TD Ameritrade will only consider this margin call met if you deposit the full amount of the original call."
"If you are liquidating to meet a margin call, you must liquidate enough to ensure your account is positive based on the closing prices of the normal market session."
"## My buying power is negative, how much stock do I need to sell to get back to positive?"
"Generally, you can take your Funds Available for Trading and divide by the margin requirement of the security you plan to liquidate to determine the total notional value which must be liquidated to get back to positive."
"Liquidating positons can be complex, if you need additional assistance call a margin Specialist at 877-877-0272 ext 1."
"Example 1: The following account is deficient by $2,000 and is looking to get back to positive by selling a stock in the account which has a 40% margin requirement."
"Funds Availabe for Trading | Stock Buying Power ---|--- -2000 | -6666.67 -2000/40%= $5000 In this case, the client would need to liquidate $5000 worth of a stock with a 40% margin requirement in order to meet their $2000 deficiency."
"Example 2: The following account is in a Regulation-T call in the amount of $2,000 and is looking to get back to positive by selling a stock in the account."
"Funds Available for Trading | Stock Buying Power ---|--- -2000 | -6666.67 -2000/50% = $4000 In this case, the client would need to liquidate $4000 worth of stock in order to meet the $2000 Reg-T call."
_The deposit of marginable securities does not give dollar-for-dollar relief.
"In order to determine how much relief marginable securities offer, please contact a margin representative at 877-877-0272, ext 1._ ## How are Maintenance Requirements on a Stock Determined?"
"In accordance with the rules of the exchanges, TD Ameritrade places Initial and Maintenance margin requirements on accounts."
These requirements dictate the amount of equity needed in an account in order to hold and create new margin positions.
"All broker/dealers, including TD Ameritrade, Inc., reserve the right at any time to adjust minimum maintenance requirements."
"This adjustment can be done on an individual account basis as well as on a stock-by-stock basis, depending on a stock's trading volatility and other factors."
Your account may be subject to higher margin equity requirements based on how market fluctuations affect your portfolio.
Below are the maintenance requirements for most long and short positions.
"However, concentrated positions and certain stocks may have special requirements between 35% and 100%."
Non-marginable stocks cannot be used as collateral for a margin loan.
"Likewise, you may not use margin to purchase non-marginable stocks."
Postion | Minimum Maintenance Requirement ---|--- Long stock position valued at $4.01 per share or more | 30% of the current market value of the stock Long stock position value between $2 and $4 per share | $2 per share Long stock position valued at $1.99 or less per share | 100% of the current market value of the stock Short stock position valued at $16.67 per share or more | 30% of the current market value of the stock Short stock position valued between $5.01 and $16.67 per share | $5 per share Short stock position valued between $2.50 and $5 per share | 100% of the current market value of the stock Short stock position valued at less than $2.50 per share | $2.50 per share ## What is a Special Margin requirement?
Some securities have special maintenance requirements that require you to have a higher percentage of equity in your account in order to hold them on margin.
"Typically, they are placed on positions held in the account that pose a greater risk."
"These higher-risk positions may include lower-priced securities, highly concentrated positions, highly volatile securities, leveraged positions and other factors."
There are no restrictions from trading securities with special maintenance requirements as long as the requirement can be met.
For more information on Concentrated Positions (hyperlink to page) or contact a Margin Specialist at 877-877-0272 ext 1.
## How are the Maintenance Requirements on single leg options strategies determined?
Long Options : The buyer of long options must pay 100% of the purchase price.
Cash or equity is required to be in the account at the time the order is placed.
Regulation T and maintenance requirements are also 100%.
Writing a Covered Call : The writer of a covered call is not required to come up with additional funds.
The backing for the call is the stock.
"During the life of the covered call, the underlying security cannot be valued higher, for margin requirement and account equity purposes, than the strike price of the short call."
Writing a Cash Secured Put : The put-writer must maintain a cash balance equal to the total exercise value of the contracts.
"If the option is assigned, the writer of the put option purchases the security with the cash that has been held to cover the put."
Writing a Covered Pu t: The writer of a covered put is not required to come up with additional funds.
The backing for the put is the short stock.
"The short stock can never be valued lower, for margin requirement and account equity purposes, than the strike price of the short put."
"Uncovered Equity Options Because writing uncovered or naked-options represents greater risk of loss, the margin requirements are higher."
The minimum equity for writing uncovered options is $5000 and requires an initial deposit and maintenance of the greatest of the following three formulas: 1.
"20% of the underlying stock less the out of the money amount (if any), plus 100% of the current market value of the option 2."
Calls: 10% of current market value of the stock PLUS the premium valuePuts: 10% of Exercise Value of the underlying stock PLUS the premium value 3.
"50 per contract plus 100 % of the premium Scenario 1 | ---|--- # of naked puts | 5 Price of security | $81.25 Strike price of option | $81.00 Option premium | $2.00 Example 1 20% Calculation | ---|--- Percentage of Stock Value: 20% x [$81.25 x (5 x 100)] | $8,125.00 Out-of-the-Money Amount: ($81 - $81.25) x 500 | -$125.00 Current Value of the Option: $2.00 x 500 | $1,000.00 Total Requirement | $9000.00 Example 2 10% Calculation | ---|--- Percentage of Strike Value: 10% x [$81.25 x (5 x 100)] | $4,050.00 Current Value of the Option: $2.00 x 500 | $1,000.00 Total Requirement | $5,050.00 Example 3 $50 plus premium Calculation | ---|--- $50 x 5 contacts | $250.00 Current Value of the Option: $2.00 x 500 | $1,000.00 Total Requirement | $1,250.00 In Scenario 1, the margin requirement would be $9000 as it is the highest requirement of the 3 examples."

## What are the Maintenance Requirements for Equity Spreads?
Equity spreads Debit Spreads \- The buyer of a debit spread must pay 100% of the purchase price of the spread.
Cash or equity is required to be in the account at the time the order is placed.
Regulation T and maintenance requirements are also 100%.
"Debit Spread Scenario Client buys 5 of the October 65/60 put spread in XYZ security for $1.75 Spread Scenario | ---|--- Price of Security | $65.23 # of October Puts Purchased | 5 Strike Price | $65.00 Option Premium Paid | $2.00 # of October Puts Sold | 5 Strike Price | $60.00 Option Premium Received | $0.25 Example Long Spread Calculation | ---|--- Premium Paid for 65 puts: $2 x (5 x 100) | $1000.00 Premium Received for 60 puts: $0.25 x (5 x 100) | ($125.00) Total Requirement | $875.00 _In this scenario, the margin requirement would be the total cash spent purchasing the debit spread, $875."
_ Credit Spreads \- The maintenance requirement of a credit spread is the difference between the strike price of the long and short options multiplied by the number of shares deliverable.
Cash generated from the sale will be applied to this requirement and the difference will be due upon execution of the trade.
"Credit Spread Scenario Client sells 5 of the October 70/65 put spread in XYZ security for $3.25 Spread Scenario | ---|--- Price of Security | $65.25 # of October Puts Sold | 5 Strike Price | $70.00 Option Premium Received | $5.75 # of October Puts Purchased | 5 Strike Price | $65.00 Option Premium Paid | $2.00 Example Short Spread Calculation | ---|--- Strike Multiplied by # Contracts sold: $70 x (5 x 100) | $35,000.00 Strike Multiplied by # Contratcs bought: $65 x (5 x 100) | ($32,500.00) Total Requirement | $2,500.00 _The margin requirement for this spread is $2500."
"The client will collect $1875 from the sale of the spread ((5.75-2.00) 500)) and will be responsible for having the difference between the margin requirement and premium collected, $625, when entering the trade."
_ Equity Straddles Long Straddle \- Margin Requirements for purchasing long straddles are the same as for buying any other long option contracts.
The buyer of a long straddle must pay 100% of the purchase price.
Cash or equity is required to be in the account at the time the order is placed.
"Regulation T and maintenance requirements are also 100% Straddle Scenario Client buys 5 October 65 Straddles in XYZ Security for $4.25 Spread Scenario | ---|--- Price of Security | $62.25 # of October Puts Purchased | 5 Strike Price | $65.00 Option Premium Paid | $2.00 # of October Calls Purchased | 5 Strike Price | $65.00 Option Premium Paid | $2.25 Example Long Straddle Calculation | ---|--- Premium Paid for 65 Puts: $2 x (5 x 100) | $1000.00 Premium Paid for 65 Calls: $2.25 x (5 x 100) | $1,125.00 Total Requirement | $2,125.00 _In this scenario, the margin requirement would be the total cash spent purchasing the straddle, $2125._ Short Straddle The margin requirement is the greater of the uncovered requirement for the calls or puts, plus the value of the premium received on the other, non- holding , side of the straddle, and a minimum account value of $5000."
"Straddle Scenario Client sells 5 October 65 Straddles in XYZ Security for $4.25 Spread Scenario | ---|--- Price of Security | $65.25 # of October Puts sold | 5 Strike Price | $65.00 Option Premium received | $2.00 # of October Calls sold | 5 Strike Price | $65.00 Option Premium Received | $2.25 20% Calculation for Call | ---|--- Percentage of Stock Value: 20% x [$65.25 x (5 x 100)] | $6,525.00 Out-of-the-Money Amount: | $0.00 Current Value of the Option: $2.25 x 500 | $1,125.00 Total Requirement | $7,650.00 20% Calculation for Put | ---|--- Percentage of Stock Value: 20% x [$65.25 x (5 x 100)] | $6,525.00 Out-of-the-Money Amount: ($65 - $65.25) x 500 | ($125.00) Current Value of the Option: $2.00 x 500 | $1,000.00 Total Requirement | $7,400.00 Short Straddle Calculation | ---|--- Greater Requirement (calls) | $7,650.00 Current Value of the Non-Holding Side (puts) | $1,000.00 Total Requirement | $8,650.00 _In this scenario, the total margin requirement for the short straddle is $8650."
This is derived by taking the margin requirement for the naked calls (the greater requirement) and adding to it the current value of the puts.
Cash generated from the sale will be applied to this requirement and the difference will be due upon execution of the trade.
_ ## What are the Maintenance Requirements for Index Options?
Long Index Options : The buyer of a long index option must pay 100% of the purchase price of the options contract.
Regulation T and maintenance requirements are both 100%.
Index Spreads and Straddles : The margin requirements to create spreads and straddles are computed in the same manner as those for equity options.
"Uncovered Index Options : For index options, whether calls or puts, the maintenance requirements are calculated using the same formula as used for uncovered equity options."
"The initial deposit and maintenance requirements must equal 20% of the current index value minus the out-of-the-money amount, if any, plus the premium amount received."
"This amount must meet or exceed a minimum amount equal to 10% of the current index value times the index multiplier, plus the options market value."
"Scenario Client sells 10 October 205 calls for $5.25 Uncovered Index Option Scenario | ---|--- #of Naked Calls | 5 Index Value | $201.55 Index Multiplier | $100.00 Strike price of Option | $205.00 Option Premium | $5.25 Example 1 20% Calculation for Index Call | ---|--- Percentage of Index Value: 20% x [$201.55 x (5 x 100)] | $20,155.00 Out-of-the-Money Amount: ($201.55 - $205) x 500 | ($1,725.00) Current Value of the Option: $5.25 x 500 | $2,625.00 Total Requirement | $21,055.00 Example 2 10% Calculation of Index Call | ---|--- Minimum Percentage of Index Value: 10% x [$201.5 x (5 x 100)] | $10,077.50 Current Value of the Option: $5.25 x 500 | $2,625.00 Total Requirement | $12,702.50 _In this scenario, the maintenance requirement for the short call would be $21,055 because it is the greater requirement of the two formulas._ _Options are not suitable for all investors as the special risks inherent to options trading may expose investors to potentially rapid and substantial losses."

## What is Margin Interest?
Margin interest is the rate charged on the amount of the margin debit balance after the settlement of your purchase or withdrawal transaction.
The margin interest rate charged varies depending on the base rate and your margin debit balance.
"If your account is margin enabled, you can see your base lending rate on the displayed page by selecting ""View margin rate"" under ""Margin."""
## What is the margin interest charged?
TD Ameritrade utilizes a base rate to set margin interest rates.
"When setting the base rate, TD Ameritrade considers indicators including, but not limited to, commercially recognized interest rates, industry conditions relating to the extension of credit, the availability of liquidity in the marketplace, the competitive marketplace and general market conditions."
The interest rate charged on a margin account is based on the base rate.
Your particular rate will vary based on the base rate and the margin balance during the interest period.
You can review the base rate and the balance schedule on the Rates & Fees page.
_Please note: The base rate may be changed without prior notice.
A change to the base rate reflects changes in the rate indicators and other factors.
Any changes will be posted on the Rates & Fees page when changes are affected within 30 days after the effective change.
_ ## How is Margin Interest calculated?
Margin interest rates vary based on the amount of debit and the base rate.
The formula is: Interest Rate x Margin Debit / 360 = Daily Interest Charge.
"Although interest is calculated daily, the total will post to your account at the end of the month."
Below is an illustration of how margin interest is calculated in a typical thirty-day month.
_The following is an illustration.
"Your actual margin interest rate may be different._ Daily Debit Balance | Margin Interest Rate | Daily Interest Charge (Interest Rate/360) x Number of Days | Number of Days | Total Interest Charge ---|---|---|---|--- $24,000.00 | 10.50% | $7.00 | 10 | $70.00 $26,000.00 | 10.25% | $7.40 | 8 | $59.22 $9,500.00 | 10.75% | $2.84 | 4 | $11.35 $ - | 0% | $ - | 8 | $ - | | | Total | $140.57 ## How do I avoid paying Margin Interest?"
"If you don't want to pay margin interest on your trades, you must completely pay for the trades prior to settlement."
"If you need to withdraw funds, make sure the cash is available for withdrawal without a margin loan to avoid interest."
You may have to wait for recent trades or newly deposited funds to settle before you withdraw funds.
## How do I view my current margin balance?
"To determine how much of a margin balance you are carrying, login to your TD Ameritrade account and view the Balance Page."
Margin Balance considering cash alternatives is under the margin tab and will inform you of your current margin balance.
## How do I calculate how much I am borrowing?
"Generally, margin balance can be calculated by using the following formula: Value of Long Marginable Securities Equity = Margin Balance _Assumes account is only long stock_ Scenario Company | Shares | Price | Total Value ---|---|---|--- AAPL | 10 | $152.29 | $1,522.90 BA | 4 | $355.14 | $1,420.56 BAC | 25 | $28.77 | $719.25 INTC | 20 | $47.70 | $954.00 HD | 35 | $175.66 | $6,148.10 | | Total Value of Positions | $10,764.81 | | Account Equity | $5,250.00 | | MarginBalance | ($5,514.81) In the above example, the clients account value is $5250, but the client owns $10,764.81 worth of securities."
The difference between these numbers (-$5514.81) is the amount the client is borrowing on margin.
## Does the cash collected from a short sale offset my margin balance?
"No, TD Ameritrade segregates cash from a short sale and does not apply it to the margin balance."
## When is Margin Interest charged?
"Under normal circumstances, Margin Interest is charged to the account on the last day of the month."
## What is concentration?
There are special maintenance requirements in cases where 50% or more of a total portfolio is concentrated into a single margin position.
"When this occurs, TD Ameritrade checks to see whether: A single position makes up more than 50% of a total portfolio, and; That single position's market value is greater than or equal to the total equity in a margin account Securities with special margin requirements will display this on the trade tab on tdameritrade.com when creating an order."
This can be seen below: In this scenario there are different requirements depending on what percentage of your account is made up of this security.
When the stock is 50%-69% of your total stock position it requires 70% of the notional value as a maintenance requirement.
When the security is 70%-100% of your account it requires you have 100% of the value of the security in available funds.
"_Note: TD Ameritrade rounds to the nearest whole number, so an account that has 49.6% concentration in a security will be rounded up to 50% and held at the second tier._ Example 1: Client has the following positions Concentration | | | | ---|---|---|---|--- Symbol | QTY | Price | Value | Percent of total holdings (position value/total stock value) ABC | 1000 | $25.50 | $25,500.00 | 72% XYZ | 250 | $35.50 | $8,875.00 | 25% BBB | 100 | $12.00 | $1,200.00 | 3% Total Stock | | | $35,575.00 | Current client account equity = $24,000 In this scenario, ABC stock is 72% of the total holdings of the client."
"ABC stock has special margin requirements of: No concentration = 30% 50% concentration = 30% 70% concentration = 40% 90% concentration = 40% So, given this table of requirements and where ABC is in relation to the clients holdings (73%), and over his equity of $24,000, his requirement on the position will be 40%."
"This is an increase above the stocks normal requirement of 30% Example 2: Client has the following positions: Concentration | | | | ---|---|---|---|--- Symbol | QTY | Price | Value | Percent of total account (position value/total stock value) AAA | 1000 | $35.00 | $35,000.00 | 100% Total Stock | | | $25,500.00 | Current client account equity = $20,000 In this scenario AAA stock is 100% of the clients holdings."
AAA stock has special requirements of: No concentration = 50% 50% concentration = 50% 70% concentration = 70% 90% concentration = 70% So given this table of requirements and the stock being the clients entire holding his requirement on the position will be 70%.
This is an increase above the normal requirements of 50% as it is over his equity and 100% concentrated.
"Example 3: Client has the following positions Concentration | | | | ---|---|---|---|--- Symbol | QTY | Price | Value | Percent of total account (position value/total stock value) BBB | 250 | $25.00 | $6,250.00 | 13% ABC | 1000 | $25.50 | $25,500.00 | 51% ZZZ | 300 | $60.00 | $18,000.00 | 36% Total Stock | | | $49,750.00 | Current client account equity = $50,000 In this scenario BBB is 51% of the clients holdings which would constitute concentration of 40% under the following concentration tiers: No concentration = 30% 50% concentration = 40% 70% concentration = 50% 90% concentration = 50% The reason this security will not be held at 40% is due to the clients equity being higher than the positions value: Equity: $50,000 > position value: $25,000 Note: Margin requirements (on all positions, whether concentrated or not), may change at any time with or without notice."
TD Ameritrade reserves the right at any time to adjust the minimum maintenance requirement of concentrated positions.
"This adjustment can be done on an individual account basis, as well as on a stock-by-stock basis, depending on a stock's trading volatility and other factors."
Your account may be subject to higher margin equity requirements based on how market fluctuations affect your portfolio.
## What are the Pattern Day Trading rules?
The Pattern Day Trading rules were enacted by FINRA to require that minimum levels of equity be deposited and maintained in Day Trading accounts.
http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules ## What is a Day Trade?
"FINRA rules define a Day Trade as the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the same security on the same day (regular and extended hours) in a margin account."
"This definition encompasses any security, including options."
"Just purchasing a security, without selling it later that same day, would not be considered a Day Trade."
## What is a Pattern Day Trader?
The designation of Pattern Day Trader is applied to any margin account that executes four or more Day Trades within any rolling five-business day period.
"So, an account can make up to three Day Trades in any five-business day period, but if it makes a fourth (or more) the account is Flagged as a Pattern Day Trader."
## What if an account is Flagged as a Pattern Day Trader?
"A pattern day trader's account must maintain a day trading minimum equity of $25,000 on any day on which day trading occurs."
"The $25,000 account-value minimum is a start-of-day value, calculated using the previous trading day's closing prices on positions held overnight."
"Day trade equity consists of marginable, non-marginable positions, and cash ."
Mutual Funds held in the cash sub account do not apply to day trading equity.
"Also, funds held in the Futures or Forex sub-accounts do not apply to day trading equity."
"To avoid an account restriction, pattern day-trader accounts that fall below the $25,000 minimum equity requirement should not day trade."
"## What if an account is Flagged and the account equity is above $25,000?"
The account can continue to Day Trade freely.
"## What if an account is Flagged and the account equity is below $25,000?"
"An account that is both A) Flagged as a Pattern Day Trader and B) has less than $25,000 equity will be issued a Day Trade Minimum Equity Call (EM Call)."
"The Call does not have to be met with funding, but while in the Call the account should not make any Day Trades."
If a Day Trade is made while in the Call the account will be set to Restricted - Closing Only.
## How can an account get out of a Day Trade Minimum Equity Call?
"An account will no longer be in an EM Call when either the Flag is removed from the account or the account equity is brought above $25,000."
## What if an account executes a Day Trade while in an EM Call?
The account will be set to Restricted Close Only.
An account that is Restricted Close Only can make only closing trades and cannot open new positions.
## How can an account get out of a Restricted Close Only status?
"The account will remain Restricted until either the Flag is removed or the account value is brought above $25,000."
## Can the PDT Flag be removed?
"Because investors are sometimes unaware of or misunderstand FINRAs Day Trading rules, each TD Ameritrade account has available a one-time Flag removal for the life of the account."
"This is a one-time courtesy that allows the restriction to be removed, however should future trading activity constitute pattern day trading, the flag will be placed on the account and we will not be able to remove it again."
## Are Futures or Forex subject to the PDT rules?
"Both Futures/Futures Options and Forex are regulated by the NFA, which has no rules on day trading."
"As such, Futures/Futures Options and Forex round trips don't count toward the PDT rules and funds covering margin on Futures/Futures Options and Forex positions dont count toward the $25,000 FINRA equity requirement."

Here is the full list of the data types: Any boolean CustomColor double IDataHolder int String Symbol Data Conversion Constants Operators ## Technical Analysis # Chapter 10.
"Referencing Historical Data In chapter 6 , we discussed how to use some past data in technical indicators, that is when you need a previous value of a variable or function when calculating those for the current bar."
"For example, ` close from 2 bars ago ` returns the Close price of the second last bar, ` close from 1 bar ago ` returns the Close price of the bar prior to the current, etc."
"What we did not discuss is how to move back to the future, i.e., use values of following bars in calculations which is also possible."
Negative numbers are here to help: these refer to the future data.
"For example, ` close from -1 bar ` ago returns the Close price one bar forward, ` low from -2 bars ago ` returns the Low price two bars forward, etc."
This might look awkward but it will surely work.
"Using human-readable syntax for referring to historical data only deems possible when some simple math is employed, e.g., plot scan = close from 4 bars ago + high from 1 bar ago; This script will plot the sum of the Close price 4 bars ago and the High price 1 bar ago."
But what should we do if we need lots of past and future data to perform numerous mathematical operations on?
There was actually a hint for that in chapter 1 when we declared recursive variables.
The following script was discussed there: def vol = vol[1] + volume; This script calculates cumulative volume starting from the first bar on chart.
The square brackets next to ` vol ` contain an index which tells thinkScript how many bars before the current was the one whose value we need.
"Just like with the human-readable syntax, positive indexes are used to refer to data in the past and negative indexes refer to data in the future."
"For example, close[1] returns the Close price of the previous bar, close[2] returns the second last, etc."
"At the same time, close[-1] returns the Close of the next bar (of course, if there are any), close[-2] returns the Close price 2 bars forward, etc."
plot momentum = close - close[5]; The example will plot the difference between the current Close price and the Close price 5 bars ago.
Historical data is ubiquitously used in built-in studies and strategies.
This is especially important when you need recursive variables as they need their previous values to be declared.
A good example of recursively declared variables is Fibonacci sequence: each number in it is equal to the sum of previous to with first numbers being 1 and 1.
"Here is a script for that: declare lower; def x = CompoundValue(2, x[1] + x[2], 1); plot FibonacciNumbers = x; Here we used the ` CompoundValue ` function which has a very interesting calculation mechanism."
"First of all, lets see what its arguments are: CompoundValue(length, visible data, historical data); So, being used to initialize studies with recursion, this function calculates a compound value according to following rule: if number of a bar is greater than ` length ` then the ` visible data ` value is returned, otherwise it returns the ` historical data ` value."
"In our Fibonacci sequence script, it assigned value of one to the first two bars (using 2 as the value of parameter ` length ` ), and, starting from the third bar, each following number is calculated as the sum of the previous two."
"As a result, we get a plot with values of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on."
"Now that youve learned to move backward and forward all across the chart, lets move on to discussing aggregation periods which actually form the bars on time charts."
Chapter 11.
"Referencing Secondary Aggregation plot scan = close from 4 bars ago + high from 1 bar ago; def vol = vol[1] + volume; plot momentum = close - close[5]; declare lower; def x = CompoundValue(2, x[1] + x[2], 1); plot FibonacciNumbers = x; ## Technical Analysis # ModifiedTrueRange ## Description The Modified True Range (MTR) study is a technical indicator proposed by Chris Lindgren to help evaluate the probability of an underlying reaching a certain price before expiration."
"Based upon the classic Average True Range study, which is believed to be a measure of volatility, the MTR introduces a new approach to using it."
"The Modified True Range is equal to the greater of two values: The absolute value of the current high minus a past value of close (by default, it's the previous close value, however, you can specify any offset); The absolute value of the current low minus the same past value of close."
This value is plotted as a histogram on the lower subgraph.
"In addition to it, the study displays the goal level: the price change to be analyzed."
Using the histogram along with the goal level gives you an idea of how many times the price has changed by the desirable amount during the specified time period.
"In order to help you calculate the probabilities, the study also displays several labels: Period Length."
The number of bars in the period you would like to analyze.
Goal.
The desirable price change.
Goal Count.
Represents the number of times the price has changed by the goal value during the specified period.

PLUM UPTICK ## How to thinkorswim # Seasonality Seasonality is a tool designed for seasonal pattern analysis.
"Combining both fundamental and technical approaches, it helps evaluate seasonal price changes and seasonal trends."
"Seasonality plots daily security price for each year specified in the time frame; e.g., a 5y1d Seasonality chart plots 5 lines, each representing the daily price of the specified type: Last, Bid, Ask, or Mark."
"While one may benefit from analyzing the price action over season of each year, it can also be useful to compare prices on the same day of different years."
"As the calendrical irregularities are eliminated, none of the yearly lines have any gaps."
Several studies have been conducted in order to reveal which markets are especially sensitive to changes of seasons.
"These, of course, include agricultural and heating oil markets, however, Seasonality can be successfully applied to many other types of price data."
"While keeping many features of the standard chart mode, Seasonality charting has several peculiarities."
"Since multiple data points are plotted for a single time interval, the volume is not shown."
"For the same reason, studies cannot be applied to Seasonality charts."
"Instead, Appearance settings allow you to view the yearly lines along with their averages."
"You're also free to add several types of drawings to the Seasonality chart: Trendline, Price Level, Time Level, Text Note, Arrow, Oval, Rectangle, Channel, Fibonacci Retracements, Fibonacci, Extensions, Fibonacci Fans, and Andrew's Pitchfork."
"In addition, you can have the Seasonality chart display available corporate actions; to do so, navigate to the Equities Settings dialog and select Show Corporate Actions ."
"When you enable the percentage mode for the price axis , each line has its own calculation algorithm: the first day's close price of each year is used as the reference level for each line, so all of them have the same point of origin."
You can fine-tune Seasonality chart using several options described in the Appearance Settings article.
Monkey Bars Expanded Standard ## Technical Analysis # OnBalanceVolumeModified ## Description The OnBalanceVolumeModified (OBVM) study is a technical indicator introduced by Vitali Apirine.
It is a variation of OnBalanceVolume (OBV) .
"In the modified version, OBV is given a smoothing (by an exponential moving average, by default)."
"In addition, a signal line is introduced."
The signal line is a slower moving average of the smoothed-out OBV.
"When the main line of the OBVM is rising, the volume might be gaining positive pressure, which may further result in an increase of the price."
"Conversely, decreasing OBVM may signify decreasing volume pressure and a further price reduction."
The main line can also be analyzed in terms of divergences from the main price plot.
The signal line can be used to identify crossovers.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The length of the moving average to smooth OnBalanceVolume with.
` signal length ` | The length of the moving average used in the calculation of the signal line.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

## Technical Analysis # GapReversalLE ## Description The GapReversalLE is a gap-based long-entry strategy developed by Ken Calhoun.
"As discussed in his article Trading Gap Reversals, the strategy is to be applied to 2-day 1-minute charts for stocks priced between $20 and $70."
"To recognize such stocks, use thinkorswim Stock Hacker."
"While trading the gaps is a base for many technical indicators, this strategy is about the proportions of such a gap."
"On certain intraday charts, sufficient gaps might indicate that the stock is currently being overbought or oversold, which may result in a reversal."
"By default, the GapReversalLE adds a simulated buy order if the price has risen by 50 cents after a gap of 10% or more from the previous days low."
Both numbers are customizable via input parameters.
"Since the strategy is long entry only, you might want to use other strategies for exits, e.g., TrailingStopLX ."
## Input Parameters ` gap ` | Defines the minimum gap (in percent) from the previous day's low.
---|--- ` offset ` | Defines the minimum amount by which the price should rise after the gap.

"OPEN_INTEREST TICK_COUNT ## Technical Analysis # DataProfile ` DataProfile ( iDataHolder data, double pricePerRow, iDataHolder startNewProfile, int onExpansion, int numberOfProfiles, double value area percent); ` Default values: ` pricePerRow: PricePerRow.Automatic ` ` onExpansion: Yes ` ` numberOfProfiles: ""all"" ` ` value area percent: 70.0 ` ## Description The ` DataProfile ` function plots an activity profile for any given input variable such as study or function."
The activity profile is essentially a horizontal diagram that gives insight into which values are most often reached by the input variable.
The histogram is calculated based on the following algorithm: 1.
The system finds the value range of the variable.
2.
This value range is broken into intervals.
"This process can be automatic (the range is broken into 85 equal parts), ticksize-based (each interval's length is equal to the minimum value movement), and manual (interval length is specified by user)."
The interval length defines the height of each histogram row.
3.
The system calculates the number of times the variable value has reached each of the intervals.
4.
Each histogram row then has a length proportional to the corresponding number calculated in Step 3.
Here is how you can read the ` DataProfile ` histogram: The longest row represents the value most often reached by the input variable.
It is also called Point Of Control.
The range surrounding the Point Of Control where 70% of the value movements took place is called Value Area and represents frequent values.
The mentioned percentage is the default and can be modified using input parameters.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | The variable to calculate the Data Profile for.
pricePerRow | PricePerRow.AUTOMATIC | The row height.
"This value can be calculated automatically (use the PricePerRow.AUTOMATIC constant to break the entire range into 85 equal parts), ticksize-based (use the PricePerRow.TICKSIZE constant to break the range into intervals, each having a length equal to minimum value movement), or manually (specify the desirable interval length)."
"startNewProfile | \- | Defines a condition, which, when satisfied, gives the function a signal to calculate a new profile."
onExpansion | Yes | Defines whether or not to show the profile on the expansion area of the chart.
"numberOfProfiles | ""all"" | Defines the number of profiles to be displayed if ` onExpansion ` is set to ` no ` ."
"If ` onExpansion ` is set to ` yes ` , then this parameter is ignored and only one profile is shown."
value area percent | 70.0 | Defines the percentage of frequent value movements to be included in the Value Area.

"If the Close price is less than the Close price one bar ago, a distance between the close and the True Range top is subtracted from the indicator."
"If the Close price is unchanged, the indicator is unchanged as well."
This study may be analyzed for divergences between the value of the indicator and the price.

"All Videos ## How to thinkorswim # Level II Level II is a thinkorswim gadget that displays best ask and bid prices for each of the exchanges making markets in stocks, options, and futures."
It is essentially a real-time ordered list of best bids and asks of an underlying that allows instant order placement.
"Like all other gadgets, Level II can be displayed as a section of the left sidebar or a separate window (see the Left Sidebar article for details)."
"In the gadget header you will see the following elements: the symbol selector, the ' _clip' icon _ , the full name of the symbol, the current market price of the selected symbol, and its percentage and absolute change since midnight."
The clip icon brings up a color-and-number selection menu; choosing a color in this menu will link Level II to all thinkorswim components with similar color.
Consider linking Level II to a watch list so that clicking through the latter will immediately display the corresponding symbols in Level II.
"For stocks and options, Level II is a color-coded display of best bid and ask prices from a given set of exchanges."
"Use the toggle in the upper right corner of the working area to switch between the pre-defined sets (books): Level II, NASDAQ Full Book, and BATS/EDGE Full Book."
"For futures, since they each trade on a single exchange, Level II displays first several layers of that exchange's book."
"When you specify the symbol in the symbol selector, you will see the real-time quotes in the working area."
The working area is divided into two sets of columns: bid-related (to the left) and ask-related (to the right).
These columns identify the marketplace or market maker at the given bid or ask price with respective number of shares to be bought or sold (ask/bid size).
"In both ask and bid size columns, the numbers represent hundreds of available shares or contracts: for example, 3 in the bid size column means that there are 300 shares or contracts ready to be bought at the respective bid price at the respective exchange."
"Since the purpose of Level II is providing you with best bid ask prices, the columns are sorted accordingly."
"By default, the bid area of the gadget is sorted in descending order by the bid price column, so that highest prices are on top."
"As it might be expected, the ask side is sorted vice versa: the default sorting displays lowest prices on top."
"You can re-sort the columns in the reverse order by clicking on the Bid or Ask title, or sort the set by exchange name or bid/ask price by clicking the title of respective column."
Level II enables you to add orders instantly.
Click on a bid price in Level II to add a sell order; clicking on an ask price will prompt you to add a buy order.

It derives its name from the fact that the price action in it is three consecutive drives to the top (bearish 3 Drive) or to the bottom (bullish 3 Drive).
"3 Drive is defined by five points X, A, B, C, and D, of which: For a bearish 3 Drive, X, B, D are tops of the price plot, and A and are bottoms."
"For a bullish 3 Drive, X, B, and D are bottoms of the price plot, and A and are tops."
"A bearish 3 Drive Fibonacci pattern is recognized if: A drive to the top is followed by the segment XA (first retracement), which is then followed by a second drive AB."
"This drive is followed by a second retracement BC, then a third drive CD."
Each of the retracements XA and BC is about 61.8% of the previous drive.
"The distance between and D is about 127.2% of the distance between B and C. A bullish 3 Drive Fibonacci pattern is recognized if: A drive to the bottom is followed by the segment XA (first retracement), which is then followed by a second drive AB."
"This drive is followed by a second retracement BC, then a third drive CD."
Each of the retracements XA and BC is about 61.8% of the previous drive.
"The distance between and D is about 127.2% of the distance between B and C. When the pattern is complete, it may suggest that the price is likely to further find support or resistance at one of the Fibonacci levels calculated based on the price level of point D. Note that the Fibonacci levels are only displayed for the last Fibonacci pattern on the chart."
"3 Point Extension ## Technical Analysis # RSI ## Description The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an oscillator that rates the strength of a security on a scale from 0 to 100, comparing magnitudes of its recent gains and losses."
"By default, the Wilder's moving average is used in the calculation of RSI, however, you are free to select a different type of average in the input parameters."
"RSI is widely used as an overbought/oversold indicator, with default values of 30 for the oversold level and 70 for the overbought."
These values can be adjusted in the input parameters.
Actual indication of RSI crossovers with the overbought/oversold levels can be enabled by setting the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value to ` yes ` .
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the RSI.
` over bought ` | Defines the overbought level.
` over sold ` | Defines the oversold level.
` price ` | The price used to calculate the RSI.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

"The first plot is drawn based on the built-in ` Correlation ` function, the second plot is based on its thinkScript implementation."
Both plots are equal on the entire interval.
"For more information about the covariance function, see the ` Covariance ` function in this section."
"Covariance input data1 = close; input data2 = close; input length = 12; plot CorrelationTS = Covariance(data1, data2, length) / ( StDev(data1, length) * StDev(data2, length) ); declare lower; input length = 10; input secondSymbol = ""SPX""; plot Correlation1 = Correlation(close, close(secondSymbol), length); plot Correlation2 = CorrelationTS(close, close(secondSymbol), length); ## Technical Analysis # ATRTrailingStopSE ## Description The ATRTrailingStopSE strategy generates a Short Entry signal when the close price falls below the ATR Trailing Stop value."

"While this system adds simulated orders based on a common technical indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI) , it also involves thorough selection of the most suitable symbol for the strategy."
"In order to help you find potential trade candidates, we created the Long Haul Filter study, a thinkScript implementation of Donald Pendregast's stock criteria, adapted for usage in the Stock Hacker Scanning Tool."
"When an eligible stock is chosen, the strategy can be applied to it."
"Since its main principle is ""go long only"", Long Haul adds only long simulated orders: Buy To Open (long entry) and Sell to Close (long exit)."
The long entry simulated order is added when the RSI falls below the oversold level but fails to rise above the overbought level afterwards; it is added to the bar that closes above several previous highs and the slow average.
The long exit simulated order is added when the close price falls below the fast average.
Long Haul also uses a trailing stop: the strategy will exit right after the price drops below the three-bar lowest.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` fast length ` | Defines the length of the fast average.
` slow length ` | Defines the length of the slow average (this number should be sufficiently greater than the fast length).
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
` rsi length ` | Defines the length for the calculation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
` rsi over sold level ` | Defines the oversold level for the RSI.
` rsi over bought level ` | Defines the overbought level for the RSI.
` rsi average type ` | Defines the type of moving average used in calculation of the RSI.
` high length ` | Defines the period upon which the high prices are found.

If the price is the lowest for the last ` length ` bars then ` 0 ` is returned.
If the price is the highest for the last ` length ` bars then ` 100 ` is returned.
"The function is calculated according to the following algorithm: ` FastKCustom = if Highest(close, 12) - Lowest(close, 12) > 0 then (close - Lowest(close, 12)) / (Highest(close, 12) - Lowest(close, 12))100 else 0 ` ## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | Defines data for which the FastK is found."
length | 14 | Defines the period on which the prices are translated into 0..100 range.
"## Example declare lower; input colorNormLength = 14; plot Price = close; def abs = AbsValue(Price); def normVal = FastKCustom(abs, colorNormLength); Price.AssignValueColor( CreateColor(255, 2.55 normVal, 0) ); The example plots the EMA using the manual thinkScript implementation and the built-in function."
The resulting plots coincide forming a single curve.
The ` FastKCustom ` function is used to assign a ` normVal ` value to each bar depending on its price.
"Zero value is assigned if the current closing price is the lowest on the last ` 14 ` bars, ` 100 ` is assigned if the current closing price is the highest on the last 14 bars."
"The ` normVal ` is used in the ` AssignValueColor ` function to paint a plot with colors ranging from red ` (255, 0,0) ` to yellow ` (255, 255, 0) ` ."
The green component of the color varies depending on the current value of ` normVal ` .

## What does PDT stand for?
PDT stands for pattern day trader.
"If you make more than 3 day trades in any 5 business day period, you will be flagged as a pattern day trader."
"As long as you maintain a net liquidating value above $25,000, there will not be any adverse effects to your account."
## What is Net Liq?
"Net Liq, or Net Liquidating Value, represents the value of your account if all stock positions were liquidated at the mark ."
"With regards to options , the mark price used is the mid-point between the bid and ask ."
"The Mark Price for other underlying instruments is calculated by the following formula: If BID and ASK are both NaN or zero, or inverted, then it is equal Last Price If Last is between BID and ASK, then it is equal to Last Price If LAST is above ASK, then it is equal to ASK If LAST is below BID, then it is equal to BID ## What is Level II?"
Level II displays the best prices for each of the exchanges making markets in stocks and options.
## What is Time and Sales?
"Time and Sales displays a record for every trade that happened for the specified product intraday including a record of time, price and volume of each transaction."
## What is Portfolio Margin?
A specific type of account margining that bases the accounts minimum requirements and available buying power upon the overall position risk in the account.
"To learn more about Portfolio Margin, please see the tutorial video below: Portfolio Margin _Portfolio margining involves a great deal more risk than cash accounts and is not suitable for all investors."
Contact TD Ameritrade at 800-669-3900 for more details _ ## What is MMM?
"MMM, or Market Maker Move, measures the expected magnitude of price movement based on market volatility."
It measures the implied move based on volatility differential between the front and back month.
The MMM helps to identify the implied move due to an event between now and the front month expiration (if an event exists).
## What is implied volatility?
Implied volatility is an estimate of the volatility of the underlying stock that is derived from the market value of an option.
"Implied volatility is the volatility number that, if plugged into a theoretical pricing model along with all the other inputs, would yield a theoretical value of an option equal to the market price of the same option."
## What is Futures Intraday Margining?
Futures Intraday Margining is the reduced holding requirement as compared to the initial or overnight margin requirement for futures trading available intraday.
The rate is generally 25% of the margin requirement for a particular product but can change at any time without notice.
"The minimum net liquidation value of $15,000 is required to be eligible."
Intraday margin applies between the hours of 8:30 a.m. CT and 3 p.m. CT. ## What is the Product Depth Curve?
The Product Depth Curve is a graphical representation of the market price of each contract month for any given futures product.
We display this as price over the expiration month of the product.
This allows you to easily display Inverted and Normal curves in the futures product that you choose.
More info on the Product Depth Curve: HERE .
## What are mini options?
Mini options are option classes that represent 10 shares of the underlying instead of 100 shares with a standard option.
They have the same expiration as standard options and are also available in weekly expiration.
The strike prices as well as bid/ask will be the same level as standard options.
## What are the commissions of mini options?
The commissions of mini options are the same as regular options.
More info on commissions in thinkorswim: HERE .
## Where can I find my account number?

## How do I save my platform settings?
"There are a number of ways to save different settings, i.e."
"drawings, charts, styles, etc."
"These are saved server-side, meaning they will be persistent regardless of the computer you login with."
"To save your currently viewed settings, click on Setup in the upper-right corner of the platform, then Save Workspace as, designate a name for the workspace and press OK."
"These are saved locally to your computer, so they will not be available if you log in using a different computer."
## How do I move my settings from one computer to another?
There are 2 ways this can be done.
We will outline both methods below.
"Method 1: Pull up all the settings that you would like to transfer from the first computer (detach your grids, charts, analyzed trades, etc), then click on Setup>Save Workspace As and give it a name."
This will create a file in the thinkorswim directory (c:\program files\thinkorswim) with a name called workspace.whatevername.xml.
Basically anything that displayed on the screen when the workspace is saved will be transferred.
"If you have several grids, open each of these and detach them so that they are displaying on the screen prior to saving the workspace."
Then go to the thinkorswim directory: 1\.
Exit the thinkorswim software 2\.
Right click on the thinkorswim icon 3\.
Left click on OPEN FILE LOCATION In the thinkorswim folder you will see a folder called Backup (this folder may not exist) as well as files named workspace..xml.
Move all of these to the new machine.
You will then be able to pull up these settings when logging in with the saved workspace you transferred.
Once the detached charts load you can then save all the necessary settings to your other computer accordingly.
For Watchlists: Export the watchlist by clicking on the printer icon on the top of the watchlist and select Export.
Then save this file in CSV format to your computer.
You should be able to import this same watchlist to the platform on the new computer once you have transferred this file as well.
"Once logged into the platform, click the small gear button on the top of the watchlist in your gadgets or in MarketWatch>Quote and select Create New Watch List."
"Next, click Import and select the file (you may have to edit this file prior to import and remove anything that is not a symbol)."
Method 2: (this option is not currently available for account holders in Canada or Asia) You can also transfer your settings by using the share feature.
"First, click the setup button at the top right of the main thinkorswim window."
"In the menu, select 'Save workspace as...' Once you have given your workspace a name and successfully saved it, click the Setup button again."
Now select 'Share workspace'.
"There are two of these options, the share option ending in the three '...' will share the current workspace, while the share workspace option with the small arrow icon, will allow you to select from a list of workspaces, in the event that you have more than one."
Once you select 'Share workspace' a new window will appear.
"At the lower right, click the button that says 'Share."
"(If this is the first time you are using the feature, you will be asked to create a nickname to share under."
Type in a name and submit.)
"After you click the button, a web link will appear in its place."
The link will be automatically copied to your clipboard.
"Now, you can paste the link into the sharing method of your choice."
You can right click and paste the link into an email to send to yourself or another user.
You can paste it to any text document and back it up on an external hard-drive.
"You can even write the link down on a piece of paper, as long as you write it exactly as it appear on screen (including upper case letters and numbers)."
"Once you are at the machine where you want to transfer your settings to, login to the thinkorswim software and click the 'Setup' button at the top right."
"This time, select 'Open shared item'."
In the new window use Ctrl+V to paste the link (right click paste does not work in this field) or manually type in the link.
"Then click 'Preview', and finally 'Open'."
You will get an option to save and rename the file you transferred.
"Once you have done this, go into the corresponding save section to load your settings."
"If you shared a workspace, go to the 'Setup' button and at the bottom of the menu you will see the workspace save."
Click it to load it onto the software.
"The share feature is available for use for more than just the workspace, you can use it to share single charts, grids, styles, study sets, watchlists, and custom scripts as well."
Sharing does not include any account sensitive information.
## How can I change the background color and font size?
To customize application Look & Feel preferences such as color scheme or font size: 1\.
Press Setup in the top right corner of the window and choose Application Settings... from the menu.
Click Look and feel in the left panel.
2\.
"Choose one of the available color schemes: dark, bright, or old school TOS."
The former two are also available in high contrast.
3\.
Choose one of the available font sizes: from small to very large.
4\.
Click Apply settings .

## How do I add money or reset my PaperMoney account?
"To reset your PaperMoney account back to its default values, you would first need to select the an account from the account drop down at the upper left of the thinkorswim software (it can't be on TOTAL ALL ACCOUNTS)."
Once an account is selected go to Monitor>Activity and Positions>Position Statement.
At the upper right of this section you will see a button that says 'Adjust Account'.
"Click it and a window will appear where you can either set the account cash or, check the box to 'Reset All Balances and Positions'."
"Check this box and select Apply, then confirm, and all of your positions will be reset to zero and your account net liquidation value will be set back to $100,000."
"To remove a single position from your PaperMoney account, right-click on that position in the Position Statement and select ""Adjust Position"" on the drop- down menu."
"Click this, and on the menu that then appears enter the number of shares/contracts you would like to remove and the cost per unit that you would like to pay/receive."
"Click ""OK"" and you're all set."
to the thinkorswim application is the sharing link pointer; to the right of the entry field; ## Technical Analysis # Drawings In this section you will find information on types of drawings that can be added to chart.
Drawings are a technical analysis method which relies more on a visual aspect than pure mathematics.
"The following drawings are present in TOS Charts: Basic Fibonacci Regression Advanced ## Technical Analysis # Pennant The Pennant is a relatively rapid formation that appears as a small wedge after a steep trend, which develops in the opposite direction: after an uptrend it has a downward slope and after a downtrend, an upward slope."
The preceding trend is crucial for the pattern formation and is often called a Pennant pole.
"The question of the slope of the preceding trend is somewhat controversial: some prefer it very steep, almost straight, while others find those with slope of 45 degrees the most desirable."
"The wedge that develops in the Pennant is relatively small, thus price action in it is almost immediate compared to other patterns: it usually takes several days to couple weeks for the Pennant to be completed."
"Breakouts happen in both directions but virtually all Pennants are continuation patterns, which means that Pennants in uptrend are expected to break out upward and those in downtrend, downward."
Pennant performance strongly depends on the initial price change as defined by the Pennant pole: those with price change more than 90% rarely fail.
Volume is usually heavy at the pole but declines throughout the formation.
"Inverse Head and Shoulders Rectangle ## Technical Analysis # Appendix D. Using NaN and Infinity Constants Ever since we published this set of tutorials, we have been receiving questions from fellow thinkScripters demanding more in-depth info on certain constructions in our programming language."
"This was a pleasure to know that our users look though the scripts of pre-defined studies in order to employ more advanced constructions, which, of course, made them wonder what certain things were."
"In this article, we're going to discuss a subject that was briefly mentioned in chapter 2 : the ` Double ` type constants."
"What you already know is that ` Double.E ` and ` Double.Pi ` stand for mathematical numbers e and pi, respectively."
"The most curious, though, have noticed that there are three other ` Double ` constants in thinkScript that are used everywhere throughout studies: ` Double.NaN ` , ` Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY ` , and ` Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY ` ."
"While they are obviously harder to get and their purpose might seem obscure, they're not really secret combos; let's see what they are and how you may use them in your scripts."
"## Double.NaN First of all, NaN here stands for ""not a number""."
"Basically speaking, this constant represents a value that cannot be plotted because it doesn't exist for some reason."
Several examples of when it happens: 1\.
OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts.
"The same happens when the script tries to retrieve OHLC values from the right expansion of the chart (i.e., from the time point in the ""future"", which doesn't have any OHLC values yet)."
2\.
OHLC values of the secondary symbol are NaN when there is a gap in the chart data.
"Consider the following script: plot price = close (""SPX""); On an intraday /ES chart, values of price are NaN when there are no quotes for SPX."
3\.
"Results of errors, where the expression has no mathematical sense, e.g."
: ` 0/0 ` ; ` 0 Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY ` ; ` Sqrt(-1) ` .
"Not being a number, ` Double.NaN ` is still a constant, so it's possible to use it in some expressions."
"However, its usage is somewhat specific: 1\."
"When you use a ` Double.NaN ` in an if-expression, the result is also NaN, no matter what is stated in the then-else branches."
"For example, the following script (which could have been supposed to check for ""not-a-number"" situations on chart): declare lower; plot Data = if close == Double.NaN then 1 else 0; will not plot anything because its output is always NaN and thus cannot be plotted."
"In order to check that close is NaN, the ` isNan() ` function can be used: declare lower; plot Data = if isNaN(close) then 1 else 0; 2\."
NaN plus any number is not a number.
"This is important for recursive variables: if at some point of recursion the variable becomes NaN, all its further values will be NaN as well."
"In order to avoid that, use the ` isNan() ` function."
3\.
The ` isNan() ` function can help you fill chart gaps with certain values.
"Consider the following script: declare lower; input symbol = ""IBM""; def closeSymbol = close(symbol); def closeSymbolWithOutNaN = CompoundValue(1, if IsNaN(closeSymbol) then closeSymbolWithOutNan[1] else closeSymbol, closeSymbol); plot Data = closeSymbolWithOutNaN; This script plots the close price of IBM without gaps."
Any possible gap in the plot is replaced with the last known value of close before it.
Checking for gaps or not existing values is not the only application of the NaN concept.
It may also be applied in scripts where you need to plot something for certain bars and nothing for others.
"Consider the following script: def isLastThreeBars = IsNaN(close[-3]) and !IsNaN(close[-2]); def isRightExpansion = IsNaN(close); def lastClose = CompoundValue(1, if isLastThreeBars then close[-2] else lastClose[1], Double.NaN); plot Data = if !isRightExpansion then lastClose else Double.NaN; This script detects three last bars by checking that there's nothing after them."
It plots the last bar's close price across these three bars and nothing for other bars and the right expansion.
## Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY and Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY These two constants were added for those who can't imagine scripting without dividing by zero.
The ` Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY ` is the thinkScript representation of dividing any positive number by zero and the ` Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY ` is its negative counterpart.
They represent respectively the positive and the negative values of infinitely large magnitude.
"While the whole concept of infinite values might seem esoteric, they can be successfully employed in your scripts."
Consider the following examples.
"Example 1 Here is a sophisticated way of plotting the smallest non-zero high-to-low range on chart: declare lower; def range = high - low; plot SmallestRange = LowestAll(if range == 0 then Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY else range); This plot replaces zero range values with infinitely large, which makes it possible to detect the smallest value."
"Example 2 In chapter 9 , we discussed a function called ` AddCloud() ` ; this function visualizes the difference between two calculated values (variables or plots) by filling the area between them with a translucent color."
"Infinity bounds though may trick it into displaying something more impressive: def hiLevel = if close >= Average(close) then Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY else Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY; AddCloud(hiLevel, -hiLevel, Color.LIGHT_GREEN, Color.LIGHT_RED); Assigning infinite values to a variable will have the ` addCloud() ` function display infinite stripes and paint them corresponding to a rule."
"In our case, the stripes where the close price is greater than or equal to its average will be painted green and the others will be painted red."
The chart will not be re- scaled because infinity values are not plotted.
"Example 3 Consider the script below: input price = close; def length = if close > close[1] then 20 else 30; plot VariableMax = fold i = 0 to length with m = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY do Max(m, getValue(price, i, 30)); This script finds the greatest of several recent values of price, with a non- constant number of values being processed."
This approach was used in the implementation of the Semi-Cup Formation study.
"Appendix C. Customizing Study Hints plot price = close (""SPX""); declare lower; plot Data = if close == Double.NaN then 1 else 0; declare lower; plot Data = if isNaN(close) then 1 else 0; declare lower; input symbol = ""IBM""; def closeSymbol = close(symbol); def closeSymbolWithOutNaN = CompoundValue(1, if IsNaN(closeSymbol) then closeSymbolWithOutNan[1] else closeSymbol, closeSymbol); plot Data = closeSymbolWithOutNaN; def isLastThreeBars = IsNaN(close[-3]) and !IsNaN(close[-2]); def isRightExpansion = IsNaN(close); def lastClose = CompoundValue(1, if isLastThreeBars then close[-2] else lastClose[1], Double.NaN); plot Data = if !isRightExpansion then lastClose else Double.NaN; declare lower; def range = high - low; plot SmallestRange = LowestAll(if range == 0 then Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY else range); def hiLevel = if close >= Average(close) then Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY else Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY; input price = close; def length = if close > close[1] then 20 else 30; plot VariableMax = fold i = 0 to length with m = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY do Max(m, getValue(price, i, 30)); 1 2 3 ## Technical Analysis # HideTitle ` HideTitle (); ` ## Description Removes the plot value from the graph title."
"## Example declare lower; plot PriceOsc = Average(close, 9) - Average(close, 18); plot PriceOscLine = PriceOsc; plot ZeroLine = 0; PriceOsc.SetDefaultColor(Color.VIOLET); PriceOsc.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.HISTOGRAM); PriceOscLine.SetDefaultColor(Color.LIGHT_GRAY); PriceOscLine.HideTitle(); ZeroLine.SetDefaultColor(Color.PINK); ZeroLine.HideTitle(); The example draws the Price Oscillator study consisting of two plots - a histogram and line."
The HideTitle function is used to deallocate equal values of PriceOsc and PriceOscLine plots and a permanent zero value for the ZeroLine plot from the status string.
"HidePricePlot SetChartType declare lower; plot PriceOsc = Average(close, 9) - Average(close, 18); plot PriceOscLine = PriceOsc; plot ZeroLine = 0; ## Technical Analysis # PositionOpenPL ## Description PositionOpenPL is a study that plots the Open Profit/Loss value for the currently selected account, based on the positions open on the currently selected symbol."
This value is the difference between a positions net liquidation value and either execution price or cost basis times the position size.
Cost basis values are provided by Gainskeeper and include the effects of commissions and tax elections.
"By default, the value is returned based on the execution price, however you can change it in the study input parameters."
The Open Profit/Loss value is plotted as a histogram on a lower subgraph.
The histogram changes its color based on whether the value is positive or negative.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` calculation mode ` | Defines which value to use in the calculation: execution price or cost basis.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` PositionOpenPL ` | The Open Profit/Loss value histogram.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

"The technical indicator comprises two PPO lines (daily and weekly), a relative daily PPO (the sum of the daily and the weekly PPOs), and the zero level."
"By default, the daily PPO plot is hidden; to make it visible, click on the DailyPPO tab of the Plots area and activate the Show plot checkbox."
"Note: in order to match the daily and the weekly time frames, all the numbers mentioned in this article are selected for usage with an aggregation period of 1 day."
"The Weekly and Daily PPO resembles closely another indicator by the same author, the Weekly and Daily MACD , and uses the same default parameter values: 12-day and 26-day EMAs for the daily line; 60-day and 130-day EMAs for the weekly line."
The PPO itself is calculated as the percentage ratio of the MACD to the slowest average.
"Note, however, that the slowest average here is selected from all of the averages used in the calculation, which means that the percent ratio is calculated relative to the slow weekly (130-day) EMA for both the weekly PPO and the daily PPO."
The relative daily PPO is calculated as the sum of the daily PPO and the weekly PPO.
"Being a percentage version of the MACD, the PPO can be used for comparing the behavior of different securities or analyzing the behavior of a single security over an extended period of time."
Potential trading signals may be found at crossovers of the relative daily PPO line with either of the other PPO lines or crossovers of the PPO lines with the zero level.
"Looking for divergences of the daily, weekly, or relative PPO from the price plot may also prove useful."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` weekly fast length ` | Defines the period of the faster EMA for the weekly PPO calculation.
` weekly slow length ` | Defines the period of the slower EMA for the weekly PPO calculation.
` daily fast length ` | Defines the period of the faster EMA for the daily PPO calculation.

AdaptiveEMA AdvanceDeclineCumulativeAvg and Absolute Breadth Index; ## How to thinkorswim # Heatmap Heatmap is a color-coded display of activity of pending orders.
"For each price level that has pending orders, Heatmap displays a horizontal bar colored according to the color-gradient scheme selected on the toolbar."
"Colors on the right-hand end of the gradient correspond to price slices with the highest liquidity, and those on the left-hand end, to the lowest."
You can customize the display of Heatmap in the Heatmap Settings menu.
"To navigate to this menu, right-click on Heatmap and select Heatmap Settings ."
You can customize the following: 1\.
Color scheme .
You can choose any of the three pre-defined color schemes.
This control is also available by default on the toolbar.
"If you wish to remove it from the toolbar, de-activate the Display on toolbar checkbox."
Legacy color schemes will become available when the Include legacy colormaps checkbox is activated.
2\.
Lower and upper cutoffs .
Lower and upper cutoffs limit the trade sizes that will be displayed in the extreme colors of the gradient.
Trades with sizes less than the lower cutoff will be displayed in the leftmost color on the gradient; trades with sizes greater than the upper cutoff will be displayed in the rightmost color of the gradient.
You can set either cutoff as: Percentage : Drag the sliders to set the cutoffs.
The values define the top and the bottom trades in terms of trade size.
_Example_ : The lower cutoff is set to 5% and the upper is set to 95% on the grayscale color scheme.
"This means that trades that have the bottom five percent of trade sizes will be displayed in black, and the top five will be displayed in white."
Those in between will be displayed using colors corresponding to the gradient.
Exact size : Activate the designated checkbox and specify the cutoff value.
"In the case of the exact size, the values define the maximum number of contracts for the lower cutoff and the minimum number of contracts for the upper cutoff."
_Example_ : The lower cutoff is set to 5 and the upper is set to 500 on the grayscale color scheme.
This means that trades of five contracts and under will all be displayed in black and those with over 500 will be displayed in white.
Those in between will be displayed using colors corresponding to the gradient.
"By default, the lower percentage cutoff slider is also available on the toolbar above the chart."
"To remove it from the toolbar, deactivate the Display lower cut-off slider on the toolbar checkbox."
3\.
Vertical smoothing .
Vertical smoothing allows you to display Heatmap using more or fewer gradient shades.
The former can be especially useful when zooming out too far on the chart.
The following smoothing options are available: Auto .
"The default option that automatically determines the optimal vertical smoothing for your Heatmap, taking into account the current zoom."
Manual .
This option allows you to set a value from 0 to 20 to manually define the smoothing effect.
None .
"This option de-activates smoothing, regardless of the current zoom."
4\.
Marked depth settings .
"To customize market depth settings, click Advanced market depth settings ."
In the menu that pops up you can configure the following: Manual Market Depth .
This area allows you to reduce the number of visible price levels on Heatmap.
"To reduce the price range, activate the Override number of market depth price levels checkbox and specify the desired number of price levels."
Extended Market Depth .
"This area is only relevant for data streams that do not support the full depth (i.e., all price levels)."
"When some price levels are not available, Bookmap still shows them: in this case, the last available trade sizes are shown for these levels."
Use the options in the Extended Market Depth area to reset the data for such price levels: either at the end of the trading day or at a specified frequency.
"In addition to the above settings, you can configure the settings for Volume bars and Volume dots ."

## How to Use Spread Hacker 1.
"In the Search drop-down menu, specify the spread type you would like to scan for."
"You can either: select a supported spread type (Vertical, Butterfly, Iron Condor, Calendar, Diagonal, or Double Diagonal) to scan for spreads of these types."
Select All so the scan will be performed among all available spreads regardless of their type.
2.
"In the Spreads for drop-down menu, you can specify a set of symbols you would like to perform the scan in."
"You can select your personal or a public watchlist, a certain category (e.g., All Stocks, All Indices, All Futures), a preset scan list, or a GICS industry list."
3.
"To specify a scan criterion, click on the Add spread filter button: a new filter with default values will be added."
4.
You can use up to eight filters in a single scan.
"To remove a filter, click the X on its right."
5.
Adjust your scan criteria by using the controls in each filter.
"For example, select a different parameter to perform the scan with or edit the desirable range of parameter values."
The latter can be done by either selecting the minimum and the maximum values of the range in the corresponding boxes or by dragging the brackets on the pre-scan diagram.
The diagram illustrates how many results there are for each of the micro-ranges that constitute the specified range.
The total number of matches is displayed live on the right.
"Note that even though each filter can display a certain number of matches in pre-scan, the actual scan may return no results, as the spread needs to match all the specified criteria."
6.
"Using the controls in the bottom-right corner of the Scan Setup area, adjust your result output preferences: how many results to show, which column to sort by and in which order."
7.
Click Scan .
The system will display a list of available spreads that match your criteria.
"To sort this list by a different column, click on that columns header so the ascending sorting will be applied."
Click on the header again to re-sort the list in the descending order.
8.
"If some of the spreads found are of special interest to you, consider clicking on the lock in the Pin column."
This will fix that spread on top of the table.
9.
"If your scan returned too many results, consider cleaning up the table by removing some of its rows."
"To do so, select the spread you wish to remove by clicking it, then click on the small gear button in the top right corner of the table and then choose Clear selected ."
"If you wish to select multiple spreads for removal, click on them while holding down the Ctrl key."
"To select a range of rows, click on the first and the last row in this range while holding down the Shift key."
10.
"If you would like to trade some of the spreads found, right-click it and choose Create duplicate order (or Create opposite order if you wish to follow the opposite trading strategy)."
This will populate the Order Entry dialog with all the necessary fields.
11.

This strategy analyzes the behavior of the white spectrum-based oscillator and adds simulated orders upon its crossovers with zero line.
The strategy allows for two interpretations of the oscillator: trend following and reversal based.
"In the trend-following mode, the strategy adds a simulated Buy order when the Universal Oscillator crosses above the zero level, and a simulated Sell order when it crosses below."
"For the reversal mode, the signals are the opposite: Buy orders are added upon crossing below the zero level, and Sell orders upon crossing above."

"This is why you are provided with the Drawing Alerts feature; it enables you to be the first to know when your drawing gets involved in a ""special relationship"" with the price plot, that is to say, the two intersect at some moment."
"Not all drawings and charts are eligible for issuing alerts: drawings need to be applied to the price subgraph and consist exclusively of straight lines (namely, Trendline , Channel , Regression Line , Regression Channel , Fibonacci Retracements , Fibonacci Extensions , Andrew's Pitchfork , Fibonacci Fans , and Price Level ), charts cannot be Heikin Ashi or Equivolume type or use a tick or range aggregation."
"In addition, the Monkey Bars and the Seasonality chart modes are not supported."
"If both the chart and the drawing meet these criteria, follow these steps to create an alert: 1\."
Add a drawing to the chart.
"In case you forgot how to do that, read this article ."
"Suggestion: enable drawing extensions; this will make it possible to issue an alert for a crossing event in the future (if, of course, the expected intersection happens)."
2\.
Right-click the drawing and choose Create alert with drawing... .
The Create Alert window will appear.
"Note that if the drawing consists of multiple lines, you need to right-click exactly upon the line for which you would like to issue an alert."
"If you prefer to be alerted on intersections with other lines in the drawing, you will have to go through these steps for each line."
3\.
"In the Create Alert window, specify when and how you prefer to be notified: In the Intrabar price list, select Crosses below to be notified when the price plot crosses the drawing in the downwards direction, Crosses above for the opposite, or just Crosses when the direction is not that important."
Add a note to be displayed in your alert book if you need one.
"In the Notify with list, you can select a sound for the alert."
Click the Play button to make sure you like it.
4\.
Click Create .
The alert will be added to your alert book.
You can also be automatically redirected to the alert book right after you create the alert by selecting the corresponding checkbox in the bottom left corner of the dialog window.
"After that, all you have to do is wait until the intersection happens."
"Once this happy moment comes, you will be notified with a message announcing the price chart of which symbol has crossed which drawing at which level."
And it's up to you to decide what's going to happen next.
Drawing alerts are only available on the main subgraph of time charts that display unmodified price.
Alerts are disabled when: Chart aggregation is tick or range.

"Designed for swing trading purposes, it calculates two moving averages of the close price and adds simulated orders based on their crossovers."
"The name of this strategy refers to the popular ""golden cross"" breakout pattern, an event where a security's shorter moving average crosses above the long-term one."
"By default, the strategy adds a simulated buy order when the 50-period simple moving average of the close price crosses above the 200-period one."
A simulated sell order is added when the price breaks below the 50-period moving average.
"Alternatively, a trailing stop can be used for exits, e.g., the TrailingStopLX ."
Note that you can also customize this strategy by changing moving average types and lengths in the input parameters.

"Support and resistance levels are found in relation to the pivot point which is the average of High, Low, and Close prices of the previous period."
See the following table explaining calculation of support and resistance levels.
"Order | Resistance Level | Support Level ---|---|--- First | Above the pivot point, at the distance equal to that between the pivot point and the Low price of the previous period."
"| Below the pivot point, at the distance equal to that between the pivot point and the High price of the previous period."
"Second | Above the pivot point, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"| Below the pivot point, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"Third | Above the second resistance level, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"| Below the second support level, at the distance equal to the trading range of the previous period."
"Compared to Persons Pivots , Pivot Points uses different determination of weekly and monthly timeframes."
"In Persons Pivots, the last complete time period (week or month) is taken to calculate the levels, while Pivot Points counts these periods back from the last day, so in the latter case, pivot levels are different each day."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` show only today ` | Defines whether to display plots for the whole chart or for the last day only.
` time frame ` | The time frame used to calculate the pivot points.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` R3 ` | The third resistance level.

"Much like the original study, DMH detects uptrend when the sum of consecutive differences between adjacent high prices is greater than the same between adjacent lows."
The opposite is considered a downtrend signal.
The difference between the two studies is that: The original DMI uses average true range (ATR) as a scaling factor for both sums in the calculation of the resulting ratio.
DMH uses the Hann windowing function as a scaling mechanism and foregoes both ATR and ratio calculation.
Using Hann windowing instead of ATR scaling helps find reduce the lag introduced by the moving average component in the latter.
Hann windowing gives most of the weight to the values around the middle of the functions period and least of the weight to the values at the beginning and the end of it.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used in the calculation of DMH.

DMA DMI ## Technical Analysis # Channel ## Description The channel is a combination of two parallel lines: the trendline and the channel line.
"Recognizing existence of the channel might be crucial to the analyst as prices often remain within the same channel, while breaking out of the channel can predict change in trend."
"In uptrend conditions, it is suggested that the trendline be plotted across the lows, and the channel line is plotted from the first significant peak."
It is said that the channel exists if the next rally reaches and bounces back off the channel line.
"Conversely, in downtrend, the trendline is plotted across the peaks and the channel line is plotted from the first prominent trough."
Going back up from the channel line after the next drop might signify existence of the channel.
"In both uptrend and downtrend, failure to reach the channel line might indicate that the trend line will be broken and the trend will get weaker or reverse."
"Conversely, breaking the channel line might be considered amplification of the current trend."
"Just like the trendline, the channel allows you to view a label showing its principal parameters."
"These parameters are: the length of the channel (as expressed in both number of bars and time units such as days, hours, minutes, depending on the timeframe you are using), the price change correspondent to the difference between the start and end points of either line (expressed in both dollars and percentage), its slope, and its height (the distance between the line expressed in both dollar and percentage values)."
"In order to add the channel to chart, choose it from the Active Tool menu."
Specify two points that will define the slope of the trendline.
The trendline will appear on chart.
"At the same time, the channel line appears: move it to desired location and left-click so that both lines are fixed."
## Properties Begin point: Value.
Defines the price value corresponding to the begin point.
Date/Time.
Defines the time scale value corresponding to the begin point.
End point: Value.

"This distance is measured along the price scale, i.e., in dollars."
Negative values signify that the channel line is below the trendline.
Channel curve properties: This section allows you to add extra parallel lines to the channel.
These can be located within the channel and outside it.

SlowRSI The Slow Relative Strength Index is a version of the classic Relative Strength Index (RSI), ... ## Technical Analysis # AccumDistBuyPr ## Description The Accumulation/Distribution Buying Pressure study is used to evaluate strength of the trend by finding divergences between price plot and the indicator itself."
It is calculated using two modes: Accumulation and Distribution: The indicator is in Accumulation mode when the Close prie of the current bar is greater than that of the previous bar.
Accumulation is calculated as the difference between the current Close and lowest of the two values: current Low and previous Close.
The indicator is in Distribution mode when the Close prie of the current bar is lower than that of the previous bar.
Distribution is calculated as the difference between the current Close and greatest of the two values: current High and previous Close.
The final value is equal to algebraic sum of all prior Accumulation and Distribution values.
Bars whose Close price is equal to that of the previous bar add zero to the final result.
The trend strength can be evaluated using the following algorithm.
"If the market makes new highs while the indicator decreases, it is a signal of weakening uptrend; market making new lows while the indicator is rising suggests weakening downtrend."

"The K coefficient takes into account Big Point Value (the profit obtained in case one contract goes up by one full point), initial margin requirements, and the commission to be paid."
The CSI study is is designed to define which commodities are suitable for short-term trading.
The larger CSI value suggests the stronger trend and volatility characteristics.

FallingThreeMethods IdenticalThreeCrows ## Technical Analysis # TechnicalStockRating ## Description The Technical Stock Rating study is a rating system developed by Markos Katsanos.
"When applied to a stock symbol, the system evaluates its performance based on five technical analysis criteria."
The stock is then assigned a rating based on how many criteria it satisfies.
"For greater flexibility, the study also uses a system of weights as optimization may be required for some symbols."
The following criteria are taken into account when assigning a rating to a stock symbol: Money flow: This criterion is met if the symbol's current Volume Flow Indicator value is positive.
Trading above average: This criterion is met if the close price is greater than its simple moving average (SMA).
In uptrend: This criterion is met if the SMA value has increased over the last four bars.
Trend quality: This criterion is met if the total number of crossovers between the price and its moving average during the lookup period does not exceed a certain value.
Overall market direction: This criterion is met if the exponential moving average of the appropriate market index has increased over the last two bars.
The stock symbol receives one point for meeting each of the above criteria if all the weights are set to 1.0.
"By default, only the ""overall market direction"" weight is equal to 2.0; however, you are free to assign the weights according to your preferences."
Ratings provided by this system are used by the TechnicalStockRating strategy to add simulated buy orders.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` vfi length ` | Defines the period for which the Volume Flow Index is calculated.
"Used when checking for the ""money flow"" criterion."
` average length ` | Defines the period for which the simple moving average is calculated.
"Used when checking for the ""trading above average"" and ""in uptrend"" criteria."
"` trend quality length ` | Defines the lookup period for checking for the ""trend quality"" criterion."
"` max stiffness ` | Defines the maximum number of times the price is allowed to break through the SMA during the ""trend quality"" lookup period."
"` market index ` | Defines the market index to check for the ""overall market direction"" criterion."
"` weight for money flow ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""money flow"" criterion."
"` weight for trading above average ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""trading above average"" criterion."
"` weight for uptrend ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""in uptrend"" criterion."
"` weight for trend quality ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""trend quality"" criterion."
"` weight for market direction ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""overall market direction"" criterion."
` show label ` | Defines whether or not to show labels with criteria that are currently being met.

BEFORE_MARKET ## How to thinkorswim # Percentage View Percentage view is a TOS feature that enables you to view price changes as percentage values.
"This can be especially useful when assessing the price action in terms of its own previous values, rather than the absolute ones."
There are several ways of viewing price percentage in TOS Charts.
1\.
Chart Settings 1\.
Click the Style button above the chart and choose Settings... from the drop-down menu.
The Chart Settings window will appear.
2\.
Navigate to the Price axis tab and select the Show price as percentage check box.
"This will view all high, low, open, and close prices as the percentage change of the first bars close price."
This price will thus define the zero level.
3\.
Select the Show bubbles as percentage check box if you prefer chart bubbles to display the current price value as the percentage as well.
2\.
Quick Settings These settings can be also quickly customized by clicking the Price axis settings button in the top right corner of the chart.
Percentage view can be enabled by clicking the Show price as percentage check box.
"To enable the percentage view for chart bubbles, select the Show bubbles as percentage check box."
3\.
"Custom zero level There is also an option to set the zero level as the close price of any bar, not just the first one on chart."
All the displayed prices will also be expressed as the percentage change of that price.
Note that custom zero level is only available when the percentage view is enabled.
"In order to enable the custom zero level, right-click the bar whose close price you prefer to view as the benchmark."
Choose Set bar as 0% from the menu.
This will add a horizontal line at the level of the close price and also update the labels displayed on the price axis.
The zero level line uses the color specified for the chart grid in the Appearance settings.
"Position of the custom zero level line will be reset to default (i.e., to the close price of the first bar on chart) if you change the time frame of the chart."
You can also reset it manually by right-clicking upon the zero level and choosing Reset to default 0% level from the menu.
"Keep in mind that if there are any of the Comparison studies on chart, they will use the custom zero level instead of their own."
4\.
Trendline and Channel The Trendline and the Channel drawings can be used as a quick trick to view price percentages even if you are not using the price axis in percentage mode.
These two drawings display labels with all the principal parameters which include the percentage change between the endpoints.
Use the trendline as a ruler: connect any two points on chart with it and the label will display the corresponding percentage change.
"The channel, on the other hand, can be used as caliper: it allows you to view easily the precise percentage change between two points enclosed by its lines; the channel height will define this percentage."

How do I change my chart background?
What is OnDemand and what kind of data does it have?
## How can I show the risk profile for my entire portfolio?
"To see the risk profile of your entire portfolio, click on the Analyze > Risk Profile tab within the platform."
"On bottom of the screen Positions and Simulated Trades section, at the bottom of the page, there is a pull-down menu with the option to select Single Symbol or Portfolio, Beta Weighted."
"Select Portfolio, Beta Weighted, and enter a symbol at the top left of the page to beta-weight against your portfolio (for example, you could choose a broad-based index such as SPX (the S&P 500 to beta-weight against)."
This view will show you how much your portfolio is likely to move in relation to a movement of the beta weighted symbol over price or time.
"If you have more specific questions about how this works, contact our Trade Desk."
## How do I view the risk profile of a simulated position?
Go to the Analyze>Add Simulated Trades tab and click the bid or ask of the particular security you would like to analyze.
This will bring up a simulated order into the Order Entry box.
Click on the Risk Profile tab next to the Add Simulated Trades tab and this will show the profile of the trade.
The magenta line shows the P/L today and the cyan line shows the P/L at expiration.
## How do I set my breakeven price slices to a chart?
Go to Analyze>Risk Profile and click on the Menu icon on the far right of the Price Slices section.
"In the drop down, select Set Slices>Breakeven, then select the expiration date."
Your Risk Profile will update accordingly.
"To apply this breakeven price in TOS charts, click on Set Slices>Slices to Charts and click the appropriate cell in the chart grid."
TOS charts will pull up immediately and your breakeven slice will be appear on the chart accordingly.
## What is thinkBack?
thinkBack is a tool that allows you to go back in time and study simulated trades.
It displays the closing prices for the particular security you are viewing.
You can use this tool to back-test your strategies.
## How do I change my chart background?
The chart background of the risk profile is determined by the overall color scheme you have chosen for thinkorswim.
It cannot be individually modified at this time.
## What is OnDemand and what kind of data does it have?
"Think OnDemand is a back-testing feature that replays historical market activity in real-time, leaving the user in charge of moving forward and backward as they wish in the past to test their trading strategies."
"think OnDemand gives the user a virtual account with a virtual balance of $100,000 so they can enter simulated trades based on the historical prices and see the hypothetical P/L change over time."
Keep in mind that back testing is the evaluation of a particular trading strategy using historical data.
Results presented in think OnDemand are hypothetical and may not take into consideration all transaction fees or taxes you would incur in an actual transaction.
Past performance of a security or strategy does not guarantee future results or success.
"Results could vary significantly, and losses could result."
## Technical Analysis # RateOfChange ## Description The Rate Of Change (ROC) is an oscillator calculating the percentage change of the security price relative to the price a specified number of periods before.
The Rate Of Change acts like an overbought/oversold oscillator.
"The higher the ROC, the more overbought the security; when the ROC falls, a rally might occur."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the Rate Of Change.
` color norm length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the color gradient.
` price ` | The price used to calculate the Rate of Change.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` ROC ` | The Rate Of Change oscillator.

"By default, the value is returned for the currently selected symbol and based on the annual reporting data."
"To specify a different symbol for this function, modify the value of the ` symbol ` input parameter."
"To use quarterly data instead of annual, assign the ` FiscalPeriod.QUARTER ` constant to the ` fiscalPeriod ` input parameter."
LongTermDebtToCapital OperatingProfitMargin ## Technical Analysis # FourierSeriesIndicator The Fourier Series Indicator performs the Fourier transform on the price data based on the first three harmonics extracted by the Bandpass Filter .
The output data is a waveshape plot synthesized from the extracted harmonics.
The recreated waveshape can help identify price cycles.
"In addition to the primary waveshape plot, the Fourier Series Indicator calculates its rate of change."
"When the rate of change crosses the zero level, the wave could be taking a turn signifying a possible trend reversal."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The amount of bars in the primary cyclic component in the data.

LeavittConvolutionAcceleration LeavittConvolutionSlope ## Technical Analysis # MajorBearMarketAwareStrat ## Description The Major Bear Market Aware strategy provides simulated buy and sell signals in high-volatility bear market conditions.
"Developed by Markos Katsanos, this strategy examines market conditions based on a set of criteria that include historical and implied volatility, VIX readings, and values of such technical indicators as Average True Range (ATR) and Full Stochastic ."
"A simulated sell to close signal is added when all of the following is true: Over the last four weeks, the price has dropped by at least 6%."
"Both shorter-term and longer-term stochastic indicator values have risen over 85 in the last four weeks, and the longer-term stochastic is currently above or the same as the shorter-term one."
The VIX has spiked more than 100% or ATR has risen by at least 200% in the last 15 weeks.
The price is below its 20-week moving average.
The volume is at least 180% of its 50-week moving average.
"A simulated buy signal is added when all of the following is true: Over the last four weeks, the price has risen by at least 6%."
"The prior decline, however, is at least 15% (as calculated for the last 100 weeks)."
Both shorter-term and longer-term stochastic indicator values have fallen below 25 in the last four weeks and the longer-term stochastic is currently above or the same as the shorter-term one.
The VIX has fallen by at least 30% or ATR has fallen by at least 60% in the last 15 weeks.
Note : The numbers mentioned in the signal descriptions are default and can be edited.
The strategy is designed to be used on weekly charts; consider adjusting the numbers if you apply it to a non-weekly chart.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` atr length ` | The ATR length to be used in the calculations.
` stoch length1 ` | The length of the faster stochastic.

MACDStrat MeanReversionSwingLE is designed to be used on weekly charts; # Glossary R A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z ## Rally A rise in the price of a stock or the market as a whole.
Compare to reaction.
## Range The high and low prices of a stock or option recorded during a specified time.
"## Ratio Spread An option position composed of either all calls or all puts, with long options and short options at two different strike prices."
"The options are all on the same stock and usually of the same expiration, with more options sold than purchased."
A ratio spread is the purchase of an option(s) and the sale of a greater number of the same type of options that are out-of-the-money with respect to the one(s) purchased.
"For example, a 50/60 call 1-by-2 ratio spread is long 150 call and short 260 calls."
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
## Reaction A decline in price of a stock or the market as a whole following a rise.
Compare to rally.
## Realized Gains Or Losses The profit or loss incurred in an account when a closing trade on a stock or option is made and matched with an open position in the same stock or option.
## Record Date (Date Of Record) The date by which someone must be registered as a shareholder of a company in order to receive a declared dividend.
Compare to ex-dividend date and payment date.
"## Registered Options Principle An employee of a brokerage firm who has passed the FINRA Series 4 exam, which provides in-depth knowledge related to options."
The registered options principal is an officer or partner in a brokerage firm who approves client accounts in writing.
## Registered Represenative An employee of a brokerage firm who has passed the FINRA Series 7 and Series 63 exam.
"## Regulation T (Reg T) The regulation, established by the Federal Reserve Board, governing the amount of credit that brokers and dealers may give to clients to purchase securities."
"It determines the initial margin requirements and defines eligible, ineligible, and exempt securities."
## Rehypothecation The practice of pledging a client's securities as collateral for a bank loan.
A brokerage firm may rehypothecate up to 140% of the loan amount to a client to finance margin loans to clients.
## Rejected Order An order that is not executed because it is invalid or unacceptable in some way.
## Restricted Account A margin account in which the equity is less than the REG T initial requirement.
A restricted account with TD Ameritrade will be restricted to closing transactions only.
## Retail Automatic Execution System (RAES) The system utilized by the CBOE to execute option market and executable limit orders for retail clients received by the exchange's ORS.
Retail option orders executed via the RAES system are filled instantaneously at the prevailing market quote and are confirmed almost immediately to the originating firm.
## Return On Capital The percentage of the mark compared to the buying power of an option position.
"Since the buying power effect is capital that is made unavailable by the trade, the return on capital could be viewed as the amount of return expected on a sale of the position for cash."
Not annualized.
Return on capital = mark / margin req.
## Return On Risk The percentage of the mark compared to the potential loss of an option position.
"Since most spread types have defined risk that is equal to the buying power, this number will often be the same as return on capital."
Not annualized.
Return on risk = max risk.
## Reversal (Market Reversal) When a stock's direction of price movement stops and heads in the opposite direction.
"## Reversal (Reverse Conversion) A position of short stock, long a call, and short a put (with the call and put having the same strike price, expiration date, and underlying stock)."
"The long call and short put acts very much like long stock, thus acting as a hedge to the short stock."
"So, a reversal has a very small delta."
A reversal is a strategy designed to exploit mispricings in carrying costs.
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
## Reverse Split An action taken by a corporation in which the number of outstanding shares is reduced and the price per share increases.
"For example, if a trader were long 100 shares of stock of a company with a price of $80, and that company instituted a 1-for-4 reverse split, the trader would see his position become long 25 shares of stock with a price of $320."
The value of the trader's position does not change (unless the price of the stock subsequently changes) and his proportionate ownership in the company remains the same.
Compare to stock split.
## Rho An instantaneous measurement of the price sensitivity of an option relative to a change in interest rates when all other factors are held constant.
"This is typically expressed in the amount of money per option, per one-percent (100 basis point) change in interest rates."
"Rho is dependent upon the stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rates, dividends, and time to expiration."
"## Roll, The An option spread position composed of both calls and puts."
"The options are all on the same stock and strike price, but on two expirations."
"The roll is long synthetic stock (long call, short put) at one expiration and short synthetic stock (short call, long put) at another expiration."
The quantity of long options and the quantity of short options net to zero.
"For example, short the SEP/DEC 70 roll is long 1 September 70 call, short 1 September 70 put, short 1 December 70 call, and long 1 December 70 put."
The roll is usually executed when someone wishes to roll from a hedge in an expiring month to a hedge in a deferred month for added time.
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
"## Roll, To Adjusting or changing a position by closing out an existing option position and substituting it with an option on the same stock but with a different strike price or expiration date."
## Round Lot A standard quantity of trading.

The One Black Crow candlestick pattern is recognized in the following configuration of two candles: The first candle is long and bullish and continues an uptrend; The second candle is long and bearish; The second candle opens within the first candle's body limits and closes below the first candle's open.
A candle is considered long if its body height is greater than the average body height calculated for the last 20 candles.
An uptrend is recognized if the average slope coefficient of trendlines is positive for the last three candles.
Both mentioned numbers are default and can be modified in the input parameters.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of candles used to calculate the average body height.
"If the body height of a candle is greater than this average, the candle is considered long."
` trend setup ` | The number of preceding candles to check if there was an uptrend before the pattern.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Bearish ` | The One Black Crow candlestick pattern.

"Based on linear regression, this indicator extrapolates the linear regression of price for the next bar."
Here is how Leavitt Convolution Slope is calculated: 1\.
"Using the Time Series Forecast indicator, the study estimates the price projected for the next bar."
The estimated price is based on the least-squares method.
2\.
"Using linear regression, the study extrapolates this value to find a projected price change (convolution slope) for the next bar."
The resulting extrapolated value is shown as a histogram on a lower subgraph.
"By default, sections of the histogram where the extrapolated value is increasing are shown in green; sections corresponding to the decreasing value are shown in red."
Note: Value projection is purely mathematical as all calculations are based on the least-squares averaging of previous values.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the convolution slope is to be found.
` length ` | The period for which the linear regression is to be calculated.
## Plots ` LeavittConvolutionSlope ` | The Leavitt Convolution Slope histogram.
---|--- ` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

"Being one of the simplest formations, it consists of three reversal points: two bottoms of nearly the same size and a peak between them, hence the name of the pattern."
The line running through the bottoms is the resistance line which should be nearly horizontal.
"Being a clearly reversal pattern, Double Bottoms appear in the downtrend and reverse it to the upside as price breaks through the resistance line (the one running through the peak, parallel to support)."
"Premature breakouts can be a problem in Double Bottoms as they occur frequently, depending on the bottom shape."
"Performance-wise, among the Double Bottoms, the ones with rounded valleys seem to be the most desirable to find."
"On the bright side, Double Bottoms might signify a strong uptrend even after the flat base, i.e., there was no trend at all before the pattern emergence."
Double Bottoms develop rather quickly: it takes only several weeks for them to be completed.
Volume usually trends downward and this is considered more favorable than uptrending or erratic volume.

"## Today's Trade Activity In the Today's Trade Activity section of the Activity and Positions tab, you can view and manage all your working, filled, and cancelled orders."
Your orders are organized into four groups in the Today's Trade Activity section: Working orders: Orders that have been placed but not yet filled.
Filled orders: Orders that have been executed.
"Cancelled orders: Orders that have been cancelled, for example, because they were not filled by the end of the trading day."
Rolling strategies: Complex orders for rolling options.
Rolling is the process of buying back the short option near expiration and simultaneously selling the next expiration period's same strike option.
Here is how you can use Today's Trade Activity : 1.
"To see the contents of each of the order groups, click on the 'tick' icon before its title."
"To hide the contents, click on this icon again."
2.
"By default, the following columns are displayed in each of the groups: Time , Order ID , Description , and Status ."
You can add more columns by clicking on the More fields button on the far right of each group.

"All Videos Go to All Videos ## Technical Analysis # Channel Up The Channel Up pattern is identified when there are two parallel lines, both moving up to the right across respective peaks (upper line) and bottoms (lower line)."
"The lower line is identified first, as running along the lows: it defines the trendline."
"The upper line (or, the channel line) is identified as parallel to the trendline, running across the first prominent peak."
"When in the channel, prices are expected to bounce off both upper and lower boundaries; the more such reversals occur, the more reliable the pattern."
"Breakouts from the Channel Up can occur in both upward and downward directions, having exactly the opposite meanings."
"When the price breaks through the trendline, it might indicate an important, sometimes a severe change in trend."
"Breaking through the channel line, on the contrary, suggests acceleration of the existing trend."
"Note, however, that just like all the other patterns, channels might be prone to false or premature breakouts, which means that price sometimes retreats back into the channel."
Another strategy of using the Channel Up is to identify where the price fails to reach the upper line.
"As opposed to breaking through this line, the failure to reach it often signifies trend exhaustion."
This could be an early warning that the trend is going to reverse: the breach of the trendline is now more likely to happen.

"Values of this indicator are interpreted by the strategy as follows: ADX values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` crit level ` in the input parameters) and its own lowest value times a multiplier are read as indication of trend development; ADX values being greater than a higher threshold level ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters ) but lower than the maximum level are interpreted as strong trending conditions; If either of these conditions is true and close price rises above its own moving average, a simulated buy-to-open order is added."
"In the same conditions, a simulated sell-to-open order is added should the close price fall below the average."
"Simulated exit orders are added based on crossovers of the close price plot with its moving average: when the close price crosses below the average, a simulated sell-to-close order is added; when it crosses above - the simulation of buy-to-close takes place."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the Average Directional Index (ADX).
---|--- ` lag ` | Defines the period upon which the lowest ADX value is to be found (used in checking for trend development).
` average length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the moving average.

"Mathematical Functions While discussing variables, we already used the simplest mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division."
"These operations do not require any special notation and can be performed using basic characters: plus (+), minus (-), asterisk (), and slash(/), respectively."
"Also, declaration of Boolean variables often implies using comparison operators: greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equals to (>=), less than or equals to (<=), etc."
There are also equality operators falling into the same group.
"To test if two values are equal, use the double _equals_ sign (==)."
"For the inequality, use either '!=' or '<>' signs."
Here is an example script for using equality/inequality operators: def a = close==open; def b = close!=open; def c = close<>open; Variables b and c are identical: they will both have values of 0 for bars closing at the Open price (sometimes called Doji candles) and 1 for the rest; values of variable a will be vice versa.
"The full list of comparison operators can be found here ; don't be surprised when you see that thinkScript accepts some English words as operators, this will be thoroughly explained in chapter 7 ."
For more complex calculations you might need some of thinkScript mathematical/trigonometric functions.
Let's start with power-related ones.
"These functions allow you to raise a value to a power, or find an exponential value or a logarithm."
"Study the following script: def val = close/open; def data1 = Sqr(val); def data2 = Sqrt(val); def data3 = Power(val, 3); def data4 = Exp(val); def data5 = Lg(val); def data6 = Log(val); This script calculates six data values based on the initial value of the Close to Open ratio for each bar."
` Data1 ` calculates the square of this value with ` Sqr function ` .
` Data2 ` returns the square root using ` Sqrt ` function.
` Data3 ` uses ` Power ` function to raise the value to the power of 3.
` Data4 ` calls the ` Exp ` to raise Euler's number to the power of the value.
"` Data5 ` returns the common logarithm of the value and ` data6 ` , the natural logarithm; functions ` Lg ` and ` Log ` are used for these purposes, respectively."
"Let's study the syntax of calling functions in thinkScript: first, you type the name of the function, then you specify its arguments in parentheses and terminate the line with semicolon."
"If a function requires several arguments, they need to be separated with a comma see how it works with ` data3 ` variable in the example above."
"Function ` Power ` requires two arguments: value to be raised (in our case, it is variable ` val ` ) and the power to raise this value to (we used 3 in the example)."
"When working with power-related functions, you might want to use the Euler's number."
There is a built-in constant in thinkScript for this purpose: ` Double.E ` .
Word ` Double ` in its name has nothing to do with multiplying by 2: it is just a common thinkScript designation of floating-number data type.
"See how to use this constant in the following script: def val = close/open; def data1 = Exp(val); def data2 = Power(Double.E, val); Variables ` data1 ` and ` data2 ` will always return identical values as they both raise Euler's number ( ` Double.E ` ) to the power of ` val ` ."
Next set of functions we are going to discuss is trigonometric.
"It consists of six functions: ` Cos, Sin, Tan, ACos, ASin, ` and ` ATan ` ."
All of these use a single argument for which the value will be returned.
"Note that functions ` Cos, Sin, ` and ` Tan ` use arguments expressed in radians so that ` Double.Pi ` constant might be useful."
"Functions ` ACos, ASin, ` and ` ATan ` return values in radians; for details, see the corresponding articles in thinkScript reference."
thinkScript also provides you with a number of functions which round values if for some reason fractions or irrational numbers are not desired.
"These functions are: ` Ceil, Floor, Round, RoundDown, ` and ` RoundUp ` ."
"Here is an example: def data1 = Ceil(Double.E); def data2 = Floor(Double.E); def data3 = RoundUp(Double.E, 3); def data4 = RoundDown(Double.E, 3); def data5 = Round(Double.E, 3); In this script, Euler's number is rounded using five different algorithms, thus the results will be different."
` Data1 ` uses the ` Ceil ` function rounding the number to the closest integer which is not less than the number itself; the result is 3.
"` Data2 ` uses the ` Floor ` function which also rounds the number to the integer, however, this integer must not be greater than the number rounded, so the result is 2."
"Functions ` RoundDown, RoundUp, ` and ` Round ` reduce the length of the value to the specified number of digits after the decimal point (for this purpose we specified the second argument in parentheses, 3)."
"While ` RoundUp ` function rounds the number to the greater one, ` RoundDown ` does towards zero, and ` Round ` to whichever is closer."
"So, in the example above, ` data3 ` will be equal to 2.719 while both ` data4 ` and ` data5 ` will be equal to 2.718."
"However, if you round the values to four decimal places (using (Double.E, 4) as the arguments), ` data3 ` and ` data5 ` will be both equal 2.7183 and ` data4 ` will be equal to 2.7182."
"The full list of available functions with detailed descriptions can be found in the Mathematical & Trigonometric section of thinkScript reference, so feel free to research those in order to apply some complex math to your scripts if needed."

"Defining Variables In thinkScript, variables are declared using reserved word ` def ` ."
"Syntax of the declaration is quite simple: first, you type ` def ` , which will state that you are going to declare a variable, then you specify the name of the variable so that thinkScript recognizes it, add the equals sign (=) to determine how the variable is going to be calculated, proceed with expression showing how to calculate it, and dont forget to terminate the line with semicolon to let thinkScript know that the calculation is over."
Here is an example of the most basic script: def price = close; This script will retrieve the Close price for each bar.
Was it too simple for you?
Lets make it a little bit more complex: def price = (high + low)/2; Now this script will calculate the midpoint of each bar.
"Note, however, that we already have a built-in function for calculation of this value, it is called ` hl2 ` ."
"Thus, the following script will calculate the same value: def price = hl2; A more interesting thing is that you can use logical expressions to declare a variable so that the latter has Boolean values."
"It is useful when you like to check if some condition is true for some bar: def condition = close > 700; In this script, variable ` condition ` will have value of 1 for those bars having Close price greater than 700 and 0 for all others."
Note that Boolean values are translated into numerical.
"In other words, you can perform arithmetical operations on them."
"Consider the following script: def condition1 = close > 700; def condition2 = close > 900; def condition3 = close > 1100; def res = condition1 + condition2 + condition3; In this script, variable ` res ` will have value of 3 for those bars having Close price higher than 1100, 2 for bars with Close price in between 900 and 1100, 1 for those closing in between 700 and 900, and 0 for the rest."
"This script is also a good example of using multiple variables: once you have declared a variable, you are free to use it further on."
"Variables can be declared recursively, so that they use their own values in further calculation."
Lets start with a basic example: def vol = vol[1] + volume; This script calculates cumulative volume starting from the first bar on chart.
"The logic behind it is quite simple: before the calculation, thinkScript assigns 0 to the variable (it actually always does so), thus, its value at the first bar will be equal to volume."
"Then, for the second bar, it takes previous value and adds current volume to it; accumulation of volume proceeds until the last bar on chart."
You must have noticed square brackets next to ` vol ` in the script.
"These brackets have thinkScript take a certain value from the previous bar; we will study this notation more thoroughly in chapter 10 , however, keep in mind that these square brackets indicate historical reference."
"Once you declare all the variables, you might want to display results of calculation on chart."
This is done by using the reserved word ` plot ` .
This word commands thinkScript to visualize values of a variable using numerous graphical instruments.
In this chapter we will focus on the default one which happens to be line.
This painting strategy connects points derived from calculation in the manner of a broken line; here is an example script: def a = close + open; def b = high + low; plot c = a/b; This script will plot the ratio of Close+Open to High+Low.
"Note that reserved word ` plot ` replaces ` def ` , and we could actually plot the same value using a single line of script: plot c = (close + open)/(high + low); However, this is not the case when you need some serious calculations using complicated mathematics."
"Note that the value will be plotted on upper (price) subgraph, however, you are free to choose another subgraph on which the plot will be displayed; use reserved word ` declare ` for this purpose."
"This should be the first line in the script, study the example: declare lower; def a = close + open; def b = high + low; plot c = a/b; The previously discussed value will be plotted on lower subgraph."
"In order to plot values on volume subgraph, use command ` declare on_volume ` in the same way."
"For information on other ways of placing plots on chart, see the Declarations page of thinkScript reference."
"Now that you are keen on thinkScript variables, lets move on to arithmetical operations you might want to perform on them; these operations will be discussed in the next chapter ."
Chapter 2.
"Mathematical Functions def price = close; def price = (high + low)/2; def price = hl2; def condition = close > 700; def condition1 = close > 700; def condition2 = close > 900; def condition3 = close > 1100; def res = condition1 + condition2 + condition3; def vol = vol[1] + volume; and adds current volume to it; bar; def a = close + open; def b = high + low; plot c = a/b; plot c = (close + open)/(high + low); to choose another subgraph on which the plot will be displayed; declare lower; def a = close + open; def b = high + low; plot c = a/b; to perform on them; ## Technical Analysis # LeavittConvolutionAcceleration ## Description The Leavitt Convolution Acceleration study is a technical indicator designed by Jay A. Leavitt, PhD."
"Based on linear regression, this indicator estimates the momentum of the projected price change."
Here is how Leavitt Convolution Acceleration is calculated: 1\.
"Using the Time Series Forecast indicator, the study estimates the price projected for the next and the current bar."
The estimated price is based on the least-squares method.
The calculated values may substantially differ from the actual prices.
2\.
"Using linear regression, the study extrapolates this value to find a projected price change (convolution slope) for the next and the current bar."
3\.
The study then calculates the difference between the two calculated values.
The resulting extrapolated value is shown as a histogram on a lower subgraph.
"By default, sections of the histogram where the extrapolated value is increasing are shown in green; sections corresponding to the decreasing value are shown in red."
Note: Value projection is purely mathematical as all calculations are based on the least-squares averaging of previous values.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the convolution slope is to be found.
` length ` | The period for which the linear regression is to be calculated.

## Getting Started The working area of the thinkorswim platform can be divided into two parts: the left sidebar and the main window.
The left sidebar is where you keep gadgets necessary for your work.
"The main window contains eight tabs, which provide you with numerous kinds of functionality: Monitor , Trade , Analyze , Scan , MarketWatch , Charts , Tools , and Help ."
"All these tabs also have subtabs, each dedicated to a certain thinkorswim feature."
"The manual youre reading now describes these features in detail (refer to the corresponding pages for more information), but for now, lets focus on what can be found under the seven main tabs: The Monitor tab is the primary location where your trading activity is tracked."
"This includes many kinds of data: your orders, positions, statements, cash balances, and trading account status."
"The Trade tab contains the following interfaces: All Products, Forex Trader, Futures Trader, Pairs Trader, and Active Trader."
"The Analyze tab provides you with analysis techniques of many kinds, including simulation of ""what-if scenarios"" on both real and hypothetical trades, volatility and probability analyses, the Economic Data indicator database, and option back-testing."
"The Scan tab enables you to filter through tens of thousands of stock, option, futures and forex products available based on your search criteria."
The MarketWatch tab provides you with market data of many kinds as well as techniques that will help you process it.
"The following sub-tabs are available in MarketWatch: Quotes, Alerts, Visualize, Financing Rates, and Calendar."
The Charts tab provides you with a powerful graphic interface of real-time market data with an extensive selection of technical analysis tools.
"The Tools tab encompasses several handy thinkorswim features: thinkLog, Videos, and Shared Items."
"## Today's Trade Activity In the Today's Trade Activity section of the Activity and Positions tab, you can view and manage all your working, filled, and cancelled orders."
Your orders are organized into four groups in the Today's Trade Activity section: Working orders: Orders that have been placed but not yet filled.
Filled orders: Orders that have been executed.
"Cancelled orders: Orders that have been cancelled, for example, because they were not filled by the end of the trading day."
Rolling strategies: Complex orders for rolling options.
Rolling is the process of buying back the short option near expiration and simultaneously selling the next expiration period's same strike option.
Here is how you can use Today's Trade Activity : 1.
"To see the contents of each of the order groups, click on the 'tick' icon before its title."
"To hide the contents, click on this icon again."
2.
"By default, the following columns are displayed in each of the groups: Time , Order ID , Description , and Status ."
You can add more columns by clicking on the More fields button on the far right of each group.
3.
You can sort each group by any column.
"To do so, click on the header of the by which you would like to perform the sorting."
"An up arrow will appear, which indicates the ascending sort."
Clicking again will give the column the descending sort (indicated by a down arrow).
"To return to the unsorted state, left click on the header again."
4.
"In the Working Orders section, you can try to cancel an order or orders."
"To do so, right-click the order you would like to cancel and click Cancel ."
"To cancel multiple orders, try using the Cancel menu available from the Show actions button in the top-right corner of the Working orders section."
"In this menu, you can select a group of orders you wish to cancel: all working orders, all day orders, all day and Extended-Hours orders, all GTC (good till cancelled) orders, all buying orders, or all selling orders."
"In addition, you can try to cancel all the orders for a certain underlying."
"To make changes to a working order, right-click it and select Cancel/replace order..."
This will redirect you to the order entry dialog so you can modify the order.
Note : Any order can get filled or partially filled while you are attempting to take any of the above actions.
5.
"In the Filled Orders section, you can view filled orders by specifications such as execution time, price, order type, etc."
Click on the View Average Fill Prices button to view average buy and sell prices of each underlying you trade during the day.
Note : The numbers of fills you receive may not be equated to the number of orders you placed.
"Sometimes orders are filled in pieces, called partial fills, which may or may not be completed in full."
Note also that trades partially executed over multiple trading days may be subject to commission charges for each trading day.

"Conditional Expressions So far, we have discussed functions which process price data and yield some output to be considered by chartists."
"However, few will argue that technical analysis is all about analyzing if data provided by studies or the price data itself conform to certain conditions."
"For example, there is a huge block of technical indicators called Japanese Candlestick Patterns which is entirely built on conditions whether certain candles have certain shape, color and position."
"There are also less exotic examples of employing conditions in analysis: Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) , for instance, is believed to indicate strong trend upon a condition that its value is higher than 100."
"Just like many other programming languages, thinkScript offers users the standard if-then-else scheme, however, there are several ways to employ it in script."
"First of all, lets discuss usage of if-expressions and if-statements in thinkScript."
"Consider the following script: input price = close; input long_average = yes; plot SimpleAvg = Average(price, if long_average then 26 else 12); This script uses an if-expression to calculate SMA of Close price: if long_average input is set to yes, its period will be equal to 26; if it is set to ""no"", 12 period SMA will be calculated."
"If-expression is a simple way to assign one of the two possible values to an input parameter, but what should we do if we need to change the function itself?"
"For example, we might want to use an EMA instead of SMA if the input is set to no."
"Here comes the if-statement which has a different syntax but keeps quite the same meaning: input price = close; input long_average = yes; plot Avg; if long_average { Avg = Average(price, 26); } else { Avg = ExpAverage(price, 12); } Depending on whether or not long_average input is set to yes, this script will plot either 26 period SMA or 12 period EMA of Close price."
Note how this script declares the plot and the math behind it: command ` plot ` precedes the if-statement.
Using the if-statement is helpful when you need some serious mathematic calculation and keeping it in a single line of code could be very confusing.
"When you however need a simple switch like in the example above, the if-expression will do: input price = close; input long_average = yes; plot Avg = if long_average then Average(close, 26) else ExpAverage(close, 12); In chapter 1 , we discussed assigning Boolean values to a variable with this example: def condition = close>open; Once this variable outputs Boolean values 1 or 0 (yes or no), we could use this variable as a condition for the if-expression: def condition = close>open; plot Maximum = if condition then close else open; This script will plot a line connecting the higher of Close and Open for each bar."
This can be also achieved using the third type of conditional expressions: if-function.
"The if-function is, perhaps, the simplest way of defining a condition when you just need to specify numerical true and false values."
"The syntax of this function is trivial: you just specify the condition, true value and false value as input parameters; true value will be returned if the condition is fulfilled and false value will be returned otherwise."
"See how the Maximum plot from the example above can be constructed using the if-function: plot Maximum = If (close>open, close, open); As it was stated before, only numerical data can be specified as true and false values."
"If you, however, need a certain constant (e.g., Color constants ) or a string value, the if-expression should be used."
"Lets see all the three ways to specify conditions in a single script: plot Maximum1 = If(close > open, close, open); plot Maximum2 = if close > open then close else open; plot Maximum3; if close > open { Maximum3 = close; } else { Maximum3 = open; } Here, plot Maximum1 is defined by if-function, Maximum2 by if-expression, and Maximum3 by if-statement, all the three plotting the higher of Open and Close prices."
"Use the function for simple conditions with numerical true and false values, the expression for numerical or non-numerical ones, and if-statement for beautification of complex formulas you might need when creating indicators."
In this chapter we only discussed simple comparison operators yielding Boolean values to form conditional expressions.
"However in thinkScript, there are several more interesting logical operators which can be set using human- readable syntax."
This kind of syntax will be explained in the next chapter .
Chapter 4.
Using Averages Chapter 6.
"Human-Readable Syntax input price = close; input long_average = yes; plot SimpleAvg = Average(price, if long_average then 26 else 12); input is set to yes, its period will be equal to 26; input price = close; input long_average = yes; plot Avg; input price = close; input long_average = yes; plot Avg = if long_average then Average(close, 26) else ExpAverage(close, 12); def condition = close>open; def condition = close>open; plot Maximum = if condition then close else open; true value and false value as input parameters; plot Maximum = If (close>open, close, open); plot Maximum1 = If(close > open, close, open); plot Maximum2 = if close > open then close else open; plot Maximum3; ## Publications #### April 2021 In this issue: Charting for Traders: The Five Biggest Charting Mistakes You're Probably Making How to Exit a Trade (Without Losing Your Mind) Got Vol?"

"The pandemic, U.S. elections, and the civil unrest that erupted over the summer put forward more questions than we have answers."
All of which leads to the biggest question of all: Where do we go from here?
"In times of crisis, we often think about how to keep our financial lives healthy to provide for ourselves and our loved ones."
Just because the stock markets recovered from the COVID crash doesnt mean we should be complacent.
"Markets eventually come down, and traders need to be prepared for all markets."
The market rally has been fueled by high volatility (vol).
"Higher vol means more uncertainty, but it also opens up potential trading opportunities."
"That said, traders should know how to navigate volatile markets."

Thats What on page 14 explores different ways to analyze vol and strategies you could apply in different scenarios.
"If theres one thing COVID-19 has taught us, its to be ready for anything."
"Its a good idea to have checks and balances in place so you have a systematic way of tackling, not just the financial markets, but all aspects of life."
"It may be helpful to have a plan A, maybe something similar to what youll find in Black Box Trading for the Rest of Us (Sort Of ) on page 24."
"And if things dont work out like you thought, plan B kicks in."
No doubt 2020 has brought some tough challenges.
"But what makes this time in our history so appealing is the opportunity to come together, to make positive change, and to reset things when they become misaligned."
Its in our nature.
"The capital markets are a tool to be used in that process, and wherever they go next will be a product of collective optimism and fear working at the same time."
Optimism (and money) drove much of the incredible recovery from the bottom of the collapse in March.
It was a clear sign that investors have been hopeful.
But its not a prediction of the future.
Hope drives change as much as fear.

HiLoActivator HLVolatility ## Technical Analysis # PriceZoneOscillator ## Description The Price Zone Oscillator (PZO) is a technical indicator analyzing price in relation to certain levels (zones).
Two EMAs are calculated for the PZO: actual and sign-dependent.
"The latter takes into account price with sign: the price is considered negative if its value is less than that of the previous bar, zero if prices are equal, and positive otherwise."
"Once these averages are calculated, their percentage ratio is the resulting plot."
"Several levels are introduced to analyze the PZO plot: ""+60"", ""+40"", ""+15"", ""-5"", ""-40"", and ""-60""."
These numbers represent corresponding percentage values.
"For additional confirmation, it is suggested that the PZO plot be accompanied with 60 period EMA and 14 period ADX ."
These two studies are used for checking trend existence and direction.
"ADX values higher than 18 suggest that the market is trending, otherwise the non-trending mode is spotted."
"When the market is trending, the trend direction can be defined using the EMA: the price crossing above the EMA suggests the uptrend, otherwise the downtrend is detected."
"When the trend mode and direction are defined, use the crossovers of the PZO with corresponding levels as Buy and Sell signals for long and short positions (see plots' descriptions for details)."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the EMAs are calculated.
` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMAs for the oscillator.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` PZO ` | The Price Zone Oscillator plot.
"` +60 ` | The ""+60"" level."
Decline in PZO values after surpassing this level is considered a Sell signal to close a long position in a trending market (ADX > 18).
"` +40 ` | The ""+40"" level."
"When the PZO plot crosses this level from above, it is considered a Sell signal to open a short position in a downtrend market (ADX > 18, price below the EMA)."
It is also considered a Sell signal in a non- trending market (ADX < 18).
"` +15 ` | The ""+15"" level."
"When the PZO plot crosses this level from below, it is considered a Buy signal for a long position in a non-trending market (ADX < 18)."
"` -5 ` | The ""-5"" level."
"When the PZO plot crosses this level from above, it is considered a Sell signal for a short position in a non-trending market (ADX < 18)."
"` -40 ` | The ""-40"" level."
"When the PZO plot crosses this level from below, it is considered a Buy signal to open a long position in an uptrend market (ADX > 18, price above the EMA)."
It is also considered a Buy signal in a non- trending market (ADX < 18).
"` -60 ` | The ""-60"" level."
Growth in VZO values after falling below this level is considered a Buy signal to close a short position in a trending market (ADX > 18).
` ZeroLine ` | The Zero Level.
"When the PZO is positive, it is considered a Buy signal to close a short position in an uptrend market (ADX > 18, price above the EMA); when it is negative, it is considered a Sell signal to close a long position in a downtrend market (ADX > 18, price below the EMA)."

## Technical Analysis # McClellanOscillator ## Description The McClellan Oscillator is a market breadth indicator based on the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks on exchange.
There are two modes of calculating the market breadth: simple and ratio- adjusted.
"In the simple mode, it is calculated as the plain difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks."
"In the ratio-adjusted mode, the difference of these values is divided by their sum and multiplied by 1000; thus, the market breadth is normalized to the -1000/+1000 scale."
"Once the market breadth is calculated, the difference between fast and slow EMAs of this value is the final result."
It is considered a Buy signal when the McClellan Oscillator surpasses the zero level and a Sell signal if it falls below.
The primary plot is also accompanied with overbought and oversold levels.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` exchange ` | Defines market to use advance/decline data from.
` fast length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the fast EMA.
` slow length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the slow EMA.
` over bought ` | Fixes the overbought level.

"Sometimes called an arithmetic moving average, the SMA is basically the average stock price over time."
"As a trend develops, the moving average will slope in the direction of the trend, showing the trend direction and some indication of its strength based on the slope steepness."
Another analysis technique that is often used with moving averages is looking for price breakouts: crossovers of the price plot with the moving average.
Bullish breakouts are indicated every time the price crosses above the average.
"When the price falls below the average, a bearish breakout is recognized."
"By default, breakout signals are disabled; to enable them, set the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value to ` yes ` ."
"Note that since the simple moving average gives equal weight to each daily price, recent market volatility may appear smoothed out."
Long-term moving averages tend to eliminate minor fluctuations showing only longer-term trends.
Shorter-term moving averages may show shorter-term trends but tend to neglect the long-term ones.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used to calculate the average.
` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the average.
"` displace ` | The displacement of the SMA study, in bars."
Positive values signify backward displacement.
` show breakout signals ` | Controls visibility of breakout signals.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` SMA ` | The Simple Moving Average (SMA) plot.
"` UpSignal ` | If enabled, displays an up arrow every time the price crosses above the simple moving average."
"` DownSignal ` | If enabled, displays a down arrow every time the price crosses below the simple moving average."

"The Heat Map represents the price activity of symbols in a watch list based on three visual parameters: color, brightness, and area."
"Red rectangles represent symbols that have moved downward, while green represent those with upward price movement; the brighter the color, the greater the move."
The area of each rectangle is proportionate to the company's market cap.

"As the benchmark of this measurement, the market is defined of having a beta of 1.0."
"In mathematical sense, Fast Beta is the ratio of modified covariance between ROC of the security and that of the market to modified variance of the latter."
The only difference between modified and standard versions of variance and covariance is that the former uses a Weighted Moving Average instead of simple.
Securities having Fast Beta greater than 1.0 are more volatile than the market; securities with lower Fast Beta are less volatile.
Securities with Fast Beta equal to 1.0 are said to move along with the market.
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` index ` | The benchmark index against which the Fast Beta is calculated: SPX, Nasdaq Composite, NDX, Dow30, or Russell 2000."

This filter uses a weighting system for data points: the data points are assigned weights consistent with raised cosine.
"Most of the weight is given to data around the middle of the indicator's length, and least of the weight is given to data points at the beginning and the end of it."
The calculation of this filter is consistent with the formula of the Hann window function.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to which the FIR Hann is to be applied.
` length ` | The length of the FIR Hann filter.

FIR_Hamming FIR_TriangleWeighting ## Technical Analysis # RandomWalkIndex ## Description The Random Walk Index is based upon the concept of the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
"The further prices stray from that straight line within a given time, the less efficient the movement."
"The more random the movement, the greater the RWI fluctuates."
"To effectively use the RWI, it is recommended to have 2 to 7 periods for the short term and 8 to 64 periods for the long term."
This is to illustrate the randomness of the short term and the trends of the long term.
"In the short term, peaks of RWI highs correlate with peaks in price."
Peaks of RWI lows correlate with drops in price.
"In the long term, peaks of RWI highs above 1.0 illustrate a strong uptrend."
Peaks of RWI lows above 1.0 illustrate a strong downtrend.
A trading system using this index would be enter long (or close short) when the long-term RWI of highs is greater than 0 and short term RWI of lows rises above 1.0.
"Likewise, when the long-term RWI of the lows is greater than 1.0 and the short-term RWI of highs rises above 1.0, enter short (or close long)."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the Random Walk Index.

"The strategy adds a buy to ... ## Technical Analysis # Double Top The Double Top and its counterpart, Double Bottom , seem to be the simplest formations."
"Both consist of three reversal points; Double Top comprises two peaks of nearly the same size and a bottom between them, hence the name of the pattern."
The line running through the tops is the resistance line which should be nearly horizontal.
"Being clearly reversal patterns, Double Tops appear in the uptrend and reverse it to the downside as price breaks through the support line (the one running through the bottom, parallel to resistance)."
Premature breakouts in Double Tops are seen quite often.
"Performance-wise, among the Double Tops, the ones with rounded peaks seem to be the most desirable to find."
"Double Tops develop rather quickly: it takes only several weeks for them to be completed, otherwise their performance might be impaired."
Volume usually trends downward and this is considered more favorable than uptrending or erratic volume.
Double Bottom Falling Wedge ## Technical Analysis # RisingThreeMethods ## Description Rising Three Methods is a bullish trend continuation candlestick pattern consisting of five candles.
"The Rising Three Methods candlestick pattern is recognized if: The first candle is long and bullish and continues the uptrend; The next three candles are short and, as a group, form a short-term downtrend, closing within the first candle's body; The fifth candle is long and bullish again and its Close price is higher than that of the first candle."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of candles used to calculate the average body height.
"If the body height of a candle exceeds this average, it is considered long."
` trend setup ` | The number of preceding candles to check if the trend exists.

as valid parameters for the aggregation period.
The full list of the pre-defined string values can be found in the Referencing Secondary Aggregation article.
"Valid parameters for the price type are: ` LAST ` , ` ASK ` , ` BID ` , and ` MARK ` ."
"Alternatively, you can use the PriceType constants ."
"Note that for non-Forex symbols, the last three are only supported on intraday charts with time interval not greater than 15 days."

Time Charts Tick Charts Setting up Chart Time Frame Range Charts Chart Modes Using Drawings ## Technical Analysis # ESDBands ## Description The Exponential Standard Deviation (ESD) Bands are a volatility-band technical indicator proposed by Vitali Apirine.
"This indicator comprises two lines (bands) plotted, by default, two exponential standard deviations above and below an exponential moving average."
The exponential standard deviation is equal to the root mean square of price deviations from its exponential moving average.
The interpretation of ESD Bands involves several techniques: Volatility analysis.
"In ESD Bands, the concept of volatility is based on the exponential standard deviation: the higher the volatility, the greater the deviation."
"Thus, the distance between the bands increases when the volatility level rises."
"Conversely, when the volatility decreases, the bands converge."
Trend analysis.
ESD Bands are trend-following and lag price action as the exponential moving average is used in the calculation.
The bands tend to move upward in uptrends and downward in downtrends.
"In sideways trends, the bands move horizontally."
Trend reversal detection.
The distance between the bands is generally substantial to keep the price plot inside.
"However, the price may be sometimes seen pierce either band indicating a possible trend reversal or emergence."
"When the bands move upward and the price rises above the upper band, the start of an uptrend is possible."
Piercing the lower band when the bands are in downturn might signify the start of a downtrend.
Sideways trend analysis.
"When the trend is flat and the bands move in the horizontal direction, the price can be often seen form a peak at the upper band and a trough at the lower one."
## Input Parameters | ---|--- ` price ` | The type of price for which the exponential standard deviation is calculated.
` length ` | The period with which the average and the exponential standard deviation are calculated.
"` displace ` | The displacement of the ESD Bands plots, in bars."
Positive values signify backward displacement.
"` num dev dn ` | The distance between the moving average and the lower band, measured in exponential standard deviations."
"` num dev up ` | The distance between the moving average and the upper band, measured in exponential standard deviations."
## Plots | ---|--- ` UpperBand ` | The upper ESD band.
` MidLine ` | The exponential moving average.
` LowerBand ` | The lower ESD band.

"## Backspread An option position composed of either all calls or all puts, with long options and short options at two different strike prices."
"The options are all on the same stock and usually of the same expiration, with more options purchased than sold."
"For example, an 80/90 put 1-by-3 backspread is long 380 puts and short 190 put."
## Backtesting The process of testing a strategy based on prior market conditions and time periods.
Please note that past performance of a security or strategy does not guarantee future results or success.
"## Backwardation Backwardation says that as the contract approaches expiration, the futures contract will trade at a higher price compared to when the contract was further away from expiration."
This is said to occur due to the convenience yield being higher than the prevailing risk free rate.
## Bank Guarantee Letter The document supplied by a bank certifying that a person has a specific amount of funds on deposit with the bank.
"## Basis Generally referring to the futures markets, it is the difference between the cash price of the underlying commodity and the price of a futures contract based on that underlying commodity."
Cash price minus futures price equals basis.
## Basis Point A .01% tick on a 1.00% scale used to describe the yields of interest rates or interest rate products.
"For example, when the U.S. Fed raises the discount rate 25 basis points, the discount rate goes from 5.00% to 5.25%."
## Basis Risk The risk of the basis between the cash price and the future price widening or narrowing between the time a hedge position is implemented and liquidated.
## Bear A person who believes that the price of a particular security or the market as a whole will go lower.
## Bearish The outlook of a person anticipating lower prices in a particular security or the market as a whole.
## Bear Market Any market in which prices are trending lower.
"Not to be confused with a correction, but a Bear Market usually is categorized by a 20% decrease in an asset class or major index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500."
"## Bear Spread Generally speaking, it is any spread that is designed to profit when the market moves down."
Specifically it refers to a vertical spread.
## Beta A measure of the return (in percentage terms) on a stock relative to the return (in percentage terms) of an index.
For example a stock with a beta of .80 should have a percentage net change equal to 80% of the percentage net change of the index.
Therefore if the index is down 2% the stock in question should be down 1.6% (.80x2%).
## Bid The price of a stock or option at which a buyer is willing to purchase a security; the price at which a client may sell a security.
## Bid/Ask (Offer) Spread The difference between the bid and ask prices for a particular stock or option.
## Binominal Model A mathematical model used to price options.
"Generally used for American-style options, the model creates a binomial lattice to price an option, based on the stock price, strike price, days until expiration, interest rate, dividends, and the estimated volatility of the stock."
One of the main differences from the Black Scholes Model is that it factors in the possibility of early exercise of the options.
## Black Scholes Model A mathematical model used to price options.
"Generally used for European-style options, the model prices options using a probability-weighted sum of stock and a bond."
"Black-Scholes uses the stock price, strike price, days until expiration, interest rate, dividends, and the estimated volatility of the stock as variables in the model."
"## Block or Block Trade A large position or transaction of stock, generally at least 10,000 shares or more."
## Blue Sky Laws The popular name for laws enacted by various states to protect the public against securities fraud.
"The term is believed to have been coined by a judge who stated that some brokers were selling everything including the ""blue sky"" to investors."
"## Bond A debt instrument or promissory note of a corporation, municipality, or the U.S. Government."
A bond represents debt on which the issuer of the debt usually promises to pay the owner of the bond a specific amount of interest for a defined amount of time and to repay the loan on the maturity date.
"Bonds are distinct from stock (equity), which represents ownership."
## Book Value The value of a company based on its balance sheet.
"To calculate, take the total assets minus intangible assets minus liabilities."
"Basically, if a company sold all its assets and paid off all its debts."
"## Box Spread An option position composed of a long call and short put at one strike, and a short call and long put at a different strike."
"For example, a long 50/60 box spread would be long the 50 call, short the 50 put, short the 60 call and long the 60 put."
"Considered largely immune to changes in the price of the underlying stock, in most cases, a box spread is an interest rate trade."
"For all intents and purposes, the buyer of the box is lending money to the options market, and the seller of the box is borrowing money from the options market."
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
## Break-Even Point(s) The stock price(s) at which an option position generates neither a profit nor a loss.
An option position's break-even point(s) are generally calculated for the options' expiration date.
Option pricing models can be used to calculate a position's break-even point before the options' expiration date.
"## Broker A broker is an individual or firm that charges a fee or commission for executing, either on the floor of an exchange or electronically, buy, sell, or spread orders submitted by a client or firm."
"## Broker-Dealer Generally, a broker-dealer is a person or firm who facilitates trades between buyers and sellers and may receive a commission or fee for their services."
"When a broker acts in the capacity of a dealer, they may buy and sell stocks and options for their own account, which can generate profits or losses."
## Broker Loan Rate This is the interest rate that banks charge brokerage firms to make margin loans to their (the brokerage firms) clients for trading stocks and options.
## Bull A person who believes that the price of a particular security or the market as a whole will go higher.
## Bullish The outlook of a person anticipating higher prices in a particular security or the market as a whole.
## Bull Market Any market in which prices are trending higher.
A Bull Market is usually categorized by a 20% increase in an asset class or a major index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500.
"## Bull Spread Generally speaking, it is any spread that is designed to profit when the market moves up."
Specifically it refers to a vertical spread.
"## Butterfly Spread An option position composed of either all calls or all puts (with the exception of an iron butterfly), with long options and short options at three different strikes."
"The options are all on the same stock and of the same expiration, with the quantity of long options and the quantity of short options netting to zero."
The strikes are equidistant from each other.
"For example, a long 50/60/70 put butterfly is long 150 put, short 260 puts, and long 170 put."
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
## Buying Power The amount of money available in a margin account to buy stocks or options.
Buying power is determined by the sum of the cash held in the brokerage account and the loan value of any marginable securities in the account without depositing additional equity.
## Buy on Close To buy at the end of a trading session at a price within the closing range.
## Buy-on-Opening To buy at the beginning of a trading session at a price within the opening range.
## Buy-To-Cover A buy order that closes or offsets a short position in stock or options.
"## Buy-Write Synonymous to a covered call or covered write, this is a position of long stock and short a number of calls representing the same amount of shares as the long stock position."
This position may be entered into as a single order via the thinkorswim platform with both sides (buying stock and selling calls) being executed simultaneously.
"For example, a buy-write is buying 500 shares of stock and writing 5 calls."
## Technical Analysis # VolumeWeightedMACD ## Description The Volume Weighted MACD is a modified version of MACD study.
It calculates volume-averaged Close price on two periods: longer and shorter ones.
"First average is called ""slow"" and the second is called ""fast""; Volume Weighted MACD is equal to the difference between these two values."
The main plot is accompanied with its EMA and a histogram showing the difference between these two values (EMA is subtracted from the Volume weighted MACD).
"It is considered an overbought position when histogram values switch from negative to positive, while switching from positive to negative indicates an oversold position."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` fast length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the fast average.
` slow length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the slow average.
` macd length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMA of Volume Weighted MACD.

"Android - Customizing the Orders Section Android - Settings and Customization ## How to thinkorswim # Custom Quotes When watching market quotes, you might need immediate calculation of certain studies for one or several symbols."
You can use the thinkScript integration feature in Custom Quotes for that purpose.
## How to Find It: 1\.
Click the MarketWatch tab and choose Quote from the sub-tab row.
2\.
Add as many symbols as you wish to the Symbol column.
"In order to do that, click the empty cell in the bottom of the column and type symbol's name in it."
3\.
Right-click on the upper row of the watchlist and choose Customize... from the menu.
4\.
Add a Custom item (or several) to the current set - one for each value to be calculated.
"Click the ""script"" icon next to it to call the Custom Quote Formula editor window."
Now you are ready to create a study whose values will be displayed in your watchlist.
"For pre-defined studies, the interface allows you to specify the study plot whose values will be analyzed, input parameters, and aggregation period - these can be set in the right section of the editor window."
"For custom studies, aggregation period can be set using the Aggregation list."
"Also, make sure you are using a convenient name for the study, which can be specified within the Column name string."
"## Example To add a 60 day simple moving average (SMA) , use the following script: SimpleMovingAvg() After that, choose ""Day"" from the Aggregation list and set the ` length ` input parameter equal to 60."
"Note that once a pre-defined study is added, you can replace it with another one by choosing the corresponding name from the Study list which is now active."
You can also use a custom study.
Consider the following example: def period1 = 40; def period2 = 10; plot a = Momentum(length = period1) - Momentum(length = period2); This script calculates the difference between 40 and 10 period Momentum values.
"As you can see, the standard thinkScript syntax is also supported in Custom Quotes formulas."
"Once you have set the Custom Quote formula, click OK ; study values will appear in the column with the corresponding name."
Note that you can adjust calculation rules by right-clicking the column name and choosing Edit formula from the menu.
"Custom Quotes are also available for watchlists in Watchlist gadget, Scan results, and Option view at All Products under the Trade tab."
"## Value Formatting In Custom Quotes, plot values are displayed using the same number of decimal digits as in tick size with a trailing zero."
This can be avoided by using the AddLabel() function for the output and then formatting it with the AsText() function.
"Note, however, that in this case the output will be perceived as text, which means that the column will be sorted alphanumerically."
"For example, in the alphanumerical sorting, 1111 is less than 12, so please pay attention to that if you choose the formatted output."
"The following script will display SMA values with four decimal digits: AddLabel(yes, AsText(Average(close, 10), ""%1$.4f"")); ## Specific Usage When in Custom Quotes, thinkScript usage is somewhat different from that in studies and strategies."
Here is the list of peculiarities: You are free to use bid and ask functions.

"Concatenating Strings In chapter 9 , we've learned a lot about methods of outputting values beside plots."
"We considered the following example for ` AddLabel ` function: AddLabel(yes, ""Average: "" + Average(close, 20)); This is where we first used string concatenation: we appended value of the average to the string using the + operator."
In this last chapter we are going to find out other ways of concatenating strings and their peculiarities.
"Beside the + operator, one can use the ` Concat ` function which was also briefly mentioned in chapter 9 ."
"Using both methods is beneficial when you need to pass resulting string to any of the following functions: ` AddLabel ` , ` AddVerticalLine ` , ` Alert ` , or ` AddChartBubble ` ."
Note that the ` Concat ` function preliminarily converts values of different types to a string.
"For this reason you can use any numeric values as the function's parameters: AddVerticalLine(getMonth() <> getMonth()[1], concat(""Open: "", open)); This example draws a vertical line with the Open value for the beginning of each month."
"The same result will be obtained with concatenation operator +: AddVerticalLine(getMonth() <> getMonth()[1], ""Open: "" + open); The following example explains what should be done if you need to concatenate more than two values: input price = close; input threshold = 100; alert(price > threshold, Concat(""Current price "", Concat(price, Concat("" is greater than "", threshold))), Alert.TICK); This example defines a local alert triggered once a new quotation arrives in case the current price is higher that the specified one."
"In order to concatenate more than two values, the example uses nested Concat function calls: concat(value1, concat(value2, value3)) But we could, of course, make the script much simpler if we use the concatenation operator: input price = close; input threshold = 100; alert(price > threshold, ""Current price ""+ price + "" is greater than "" + threshold, Alert.TICK); But sometimes using the ` Concat ` function is unavoidable: it is the only way to convert a numerical value to string."
"input isVerbose = yes; AddLabel(yes, Concat(if isVerbose then ""Close: "" else """", close)); Lets see what is going on here."
This script adds a chart label which shows the Close price.
"If input ` isVerbose ` is set to ` yes ` , then the word Close: is prepended to the number."
"If it is set to ` no ` , only the number is displayed."
"As you can see from this example, in order to pass a numeric value as a string you need to preliminarily concatenate it with an empty string using the ` Concat ` function: Concat(numerical_value, """") Chapter 13."
Referencing Other Data Chapter 15.
"Conclusion yes, ""Average: "" + Average(close, 20)); input price = close; input threshold = 100; is greater than "", threshold))), Alert.TICK); input price = close; input threshold = 100; is greater than "" + threshold, Alert.TICK); input isVerbose = yes; yes, Concat(if isVerbose then ""Close: "" else """", close)); ## Technical Analysis # BeltHold ## Description Belt Hold is a trend reversal candlestick pattern which is a candle of specific shape."
The bearish Belt Hold candlestick pattern is recognized in the uptrend if: This candle is long and bearish and opens above the previous candle's High price; The difference between its Open price and the previous candle's High price is greater than the average body height.

ADXCrossover Alpha2 ## How to thinkorswim # Risk-Based Concentration (RBC) Margin System: How It Works Risk-based concentration (RBC) margin is a new margin system available to all margin-approved retail accounts.
RBC margin is a model that compares the theoretical loss of a position in your account to your accounts net liquidation value.
"If the position loss creates a negative net liquidation value in your account, we call this exposure."
We maintain an Expected Price Range (EPR) for each security for which you can trade.
This EPR is theoretical estimate in which we expect the security could potentially move up or down a given amount in a single day.
The EPR is not a predictor of price movement.
"Rather, it is a calculation of what the securitys price could realistically move in a day in response to an external factor such as news or a general market shock."
"This calculation is based on criteria such as the securitys volatility, historical data, liquidity, among others."
"Similarly, a Point of No Return (PNR) is calculated for each underlying security in your account."
"This represents the percentage move the security would have to make, based on your direction of risk, before you would lose your entire account value."
"Beyond this point, the account could become unsecured."
An example of these EPR and PNR values is shown in figure 1.
"Simply put, this percentage represents how much of a price move your equity can support before your account value goes to zero."
FIGURE 1: EXAMPLE OF RBC MARGIN RISK METRICS.
This table displays the positions maintenance requirements and shows the accounts PNR versus the stocks EPR.
"In this example, the account can handle a 55.32% move on XYZ and the theoretical expected price range is 50%."
Source: thinkorswim.
_For illustrative purposes only.
Past performance does not guarantee future results._ RBC margin compares these two figures.
"If the PNR of a position is outside of the EPR range we have for the security, you are only required to hold the lowest possible maintenance requirement for that security, which may still be higher than the minimum 30%, depending on special margin requirements."
"However, if your position's PNR falls within this range, then that position has exposure and your account can no longer support that potential move."
An example representing exposure can be seen in figure 2.
"Another way to view this: if your account (PNR) is inside the expected potential price movement (EPR), your account is in danger of having a negative value, which we call the risk exposure amount."
FIGURE 2: EXAMPLE OF RBC MARGIN EXPOSURE.
"Note how the PNR is now in red, this indicates this position has exposure."
"In this example, XYZ has the base requirement of 40%, but the exposure would cause the requirement to become 50%."
Source: thinkorswim.
_For illustrative purposes only.
"Past performance does not guarantee future results._ This exposure causes the maintenance requirement to be held at the EPR percentage in the direction of risk, which is often higher than the base requirement."
"In turn, this new requirement can sometimes lead to a significant change to your available funds which can create a margin call."
This margin call may need to be met immediately as margin calls caused because of position exposure are much more urgent than other types of margin calls.
"Please note: depending on the exposure of the position, we may require immediate action at any time."
There are ways to track this exposure on the thinkorswim platform when trading.
Under Monitor > Activity & Positions you can click on the numerical value on the far right of your underlying position either labeled BP Effect or Margin Req.
"This will show you the upside and downside EPR for the security, as well as where your PNR lies."
"If the number is in red, this means that your PNR would be achieved prior to the EPR and that you are carrying too much exposure in that position."
_RBC margining involves a great deal more risk than cash accounts and is not suitable for all investors.
Minimum qualification requirements apply.
RBC margining is not available in all account types.
This is not an all-inclusive metric to the risk in any account.
"We evaluate numerous other house risk metrics and rules that may require you to reduce a position(s) for other reasons._ _Use of RBC margin involves unique and significant risks, including increased leverage, which increases the amount of potential loss, and shortened and stricter time frames for meeting deficiencies, which increase the risk of involuntary liquidation."
"Client, account, and position eligibility requirements exist and approval is not guaranteed._ _Margin trading increases risk of loss and includes the possibility of a forced sale if account equity drops below required levels."
Margin is not available in all account types.

"The difference is that DYMI uses variable time periods (from 3 to 30), whereas RSI uses fixed ones."
The variability of the time periods used in the DYMI is controlled by recent volatility of prices.
The more volatile prices suggest the more sensitive DYMI towards price changes.
"During quiet market conditions, DYMI uses more time periods than when more active markets occur."
"As a result, the DYMI is more sensitive to fluctuations in the market and displays changes more rapidly than the RSI can."

"Being a modification of the well-known J. Welles Wilder, Jr.'s Average True Range (ATR) , it shares ATR's purpose of measuring volatility."
"On the other hand, the APTR measures it in another dimension: using percentage values instead of absolute ones allows comparing volatility of different securities."
"Much like the standard ATR, the percentage version uses true range as the principal variable."
"In the APTR, the true range is divided by its own middle value, which yields the target percent ratio."
"This ratio is then smoothed by a moving average of the specified type, Wilder's smoothing being the default."
"While the possibility of comparing the true range based volatility across different securities is characteristic of APTR, it may be equally useful when applied to a single symbol."
"High volatility is supposed to accelerate the APTR, while low volatility tends to keep it almost flat at a moderate level."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the ATR.

It normalizes historical volatility to the 0..1 range.
Volatility Switch is calculated as a standard deviation of the ratio of difference between price and its previous value to the arithmetical mean of these two values.
"When Volatility Switch rises above the 0.5 level, volatility in the market is increasing, thus the price action can be expected to become choppier with abrupt moves."
"When the indicator falls below the 0.5 level from recent high readings, volatility decreases, which may be considered a sign of trend formation."
"According to Ron McEwan's article, Volatility Switch should be used together with a trend following or range market indicator in order to provide you with valuable signals after the market mode is defined."
See the article on the VolSwitch strategy for information about using this study in combination with RSI and Simple Moving Average.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used in calculations.

"To place a Market Order in Active Trader, make sure youve chosen the correct quantity in the second line of the Big Buttons panel and click Buy MKT or Sell MKT ."
Proceed with order confirmation.
Entering Stop/Limit Orders 1.
Adjust the quantity in the second line of the Big Buttons panel.
2.
Hover the mouse over Bid Size or Ask Size column in the Active Trader ladder.
"You will see a bubble in the Buy Orders or Sell Orders column, e.g., BUY +1 STOP."
"This bubble indicates trade direction, quantity and order type while its location determines the price level at which the order will be entered."
3.
"Click at the desired price level: In the Bid Size column, clicking above the current market price will add a buy stop order; clicking below or at the market price, a buy limit order."
"In the Ask Size column, clicking below the current market price will add a sell stop order; clicking above or at the market price, a sell limit order."
4.
Proceed with order confirmation _A stop order will not guarantee an execution at or near the activation price.
"Once activated, they compete with other incoming market orders."
"With a stop limit order, you risk missing the market altogether."
"In a fast- moving market, it might be impossible to execute an order at the stop-limit price or better, so you might not have the protection you sought."
_ Entering a First Triggers Order 1.
"A 1st Triggers (First Triggers) order is a compound operation where an order, once filled, triggers execution of another order (or other orders)."
"To add a 1st Triggers order in Active Trader, do the following: 2."
"In the second line of the Big Buttons panel, choose TRG w/bracket."
This will display a new section which represents two additional orders: Limit and Stop.
3.
Decide which order (Limit or Stop) you would like to trigger when the first order fills.
Disable the other.
4.
Adjust the quantity and time in force.
5.
Specify the offset.
Offset is the difference between the prices of the orders.
"It can be specified as a dollar amount, ticks, or percentage."
6.
"Hover the mouse over the Bid Size or Ask Size column, depending on the type of the first order you would like to enter."
"Note how Active Trader adds an additional bubble in the other column, e.g., TRG+1.00 STP."
7.
"Click at the desired price level: In the Bid Size column, clicking above the current market price will add a buy stop order; clicking below or at the market price, a buy limit order."
"In the Ask Size column, clicking below the current market price will add a sell stop order; clicking above or at the market price, a sell limit order."
8.
Proceed with order confirmation.
9.
"Once you send the order and it starts working, you will see two bubbles appear in both Bid Size and Ask Size columns."
"While the first order is still working, you can drag its bubble along the price ladder so its price will change: after confirmation, the second bubble will also change its position to maintain the offset you specified at Step 4."
"To cancel the entire 1st Triggers order, just click x in its bubble in the ladder."
"Entering a First Triggers OCO Order An OCO (One Cancels Other) order is a compound operation where an order, once filled, cancels execution of another order."
"It may be used as the triggered order in a First Triggers so that when the first order fills, both OCO orders become working; when either of the latter is filled, the other is canceled."
"To add a 1st Triggers OCO order in Active Trader, repeat all steps from Entering a First Triggers (above), but keep both orders from Step 2 enabled."
"Using Order Bubbles in Active Trader Ladder When you add an order in Active Trader and it starts working, it is displayed as a bubble in the ladder."
"Bubbles indicate order price, trade direction, and quantity - and they can also be used for order editing or cancelation."
"Dragging a bubble along the ladder will change the price, so when you drag- and-drop, you will see another order confirmation dialog (unless Auto send option is enabled, which we recommend to avoid )."
"Once you confirm and send, the bubble will take its new place and the order will start working with this new price."
"To cancel an order, you can just click x in its bubble."
All of the above may be especially useful for 1st triggers and 1st triggers OCO orders.
Dragging the first working order along the ladder will also re- position the orders to be triggered so that they maintain their offset.
Clicking x in the working orders bubble will cancel both the working order and those to be triggered by it.
Note that dragging the bubble of an order waiting for trigger will not re-position the bubble of the working order: this will only change the offset between them.
Canceling an order waiting for trigger will not cancel the working order.

Ehlers, based on aerospace analog filters."
"This filter aims at reducing noise in price data, which appears to be stronger as the high-to-low price swings increase especially when chart is plotted for greater time intervals."
The Stochastic oscillator itself as calculated by this study is difference between the Close price and its lowest value on the specified period normalized to the difference between the highest and the lowest Close on that period.
"In order to eliminate noise and spectral dilation, this mechanism, however, is applied to price smoothed with Roofing Filter which only passes those wave components whose cycles are between 10 and 48 bars."
The period of 10 bars is a default maximum value for a wave cycle to be considered noise; it can be customized via input parameters.
"Ehlers' Stochastic oscillator is analyzed in relation to overbought and oversold levels, with two modes of analysis: conventional and predictive."
"In conventional mode, a Buy signal is indicated when Ehler's Stochastic crosses above the oversold level and a Sell signal is shown when it crosses below the overbought level."
"For the predictive mode, crossover directions are inverse: Buy signal is issued when the Stochastic plot crosses below the oversold level and Sell signal is shown when it crosses above the overbought level."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to which the filter is applied.
` length ` | The period upon which the highest and the lowest values of the price are found.
` cutoff length ` | Maximum period for a wave cycle to be considered noise.

"Sharing the principle of the Relative Volume StDev , it takes into account price-volume behavior in order to detect points where movement of price is suddenly restricted, the possible supply and demand pools."
"Just like in Relative Volume StDev, these points are also marked by Defended Price Lines (DPLs); the two indicators should be used together in order to adjust and refine position of the DPLs."
"In mathematical sense, the Freedom Of Movement is the ratio of relative effect (relative price change) to the relative effort (normalized volume), expressed in standard deviations."
This value is plotted as a histogram; its bars are highlighted when this ratio is unusually high.
"These highlighted bars, or ""spikes"", define the positioning of the DPLs."
"As it was mentioned in the Relative Volume StDev article, DPLs can be drawn using the Price Level drawing."
Suggestions for placing these lines are the same as for the Relative Volume StDev: Overlapping bars.
"If the indicator spike corresponds to a price bar overlapping the previous one, the previous close can be used as the DPL value."
Very large bars.
"If the indicator spike corresponds to a price bar of a large size, use its close price as the DPL value."
Gapping bars.
"If the indicator spike corresponds to a price bar gapping from the previous bar, the DPL value will depend on the gap size."
Small gaps can be ignored: the author suggests using the previous close as the DPL value.
"When the gap is big, the close of the latter bar is used instead."
Clustering spikes.
"If the indicator spikes come in clusters, use the extreme close or open price of the bar corresponding to the last or next to last spike in cluster."
Clustering spikes provide the strongest DPLs while isolated spikes can be used to confirm and refine those provided by the Relative Volume StDev.
Coincidence of spikes of the two indicator can be considered a sign of greater strength of the DPL.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of the standard deviation.
` num dev ` | The critical indicator value exceeding which will indicate the spike.
` allow negative values ` | Defines whether or not to display negative values of the indicator.

"This study continues Mr. Ehlerss market cycle research and is preceded by several other indicators, e.g., Ehlers Stochastic and Ehlers Super Smoother Filter ."
"As the first step, the Autocorrelation Periodogram takes Autocorrelation of price data filtered by Ehlers Roofing Filter ."
"The Autocorrelation function compares the data with itself a certain period back; its value of +1 would signify the perfect correlation and -1, the perfect anti-correlation."
Values produced by Autocorrelation are then subjected to Fourier transform and the resulting data is plotted in Thermo Mode .
The Thermo Mode representation of the study data may help you measure the relative amplitude of all cycle periods present in the filtered data.
"Cycles that have the maximum amplitude are visualized in color green, transitioning to yellow for those with lesser amplitude, and then becoming red as the amplitude drops to its lowest."

The Trades counter column displays the number of trades accumulated at each price level.
The Quotes counter column displays the number of quotes refreshed at each price level.
The colors used to display the values can help you identify the aggressor side: buy or sell.
Two modes of accumulation are available from the right-click menu for any of these columns: Session Accumulation (SVP) : The values are accumulated since the beginning of the Bookmap session.
Chart Range Accumulation (CVP) : The values are only accumulated during the period corresponding to the currently visible area of the Bookmap chart.
Zooming in or out on the Bookmap chart may change the values displayed in the column.
"In addition to the accumulation settings, you can configure the following display options for any of the columns: 1\."

Downtrend and non-trending market conditions are considered in this strategy.
"To check for trend existence, PriceZoneOscillator strategies use the Average Directional Index (ADX)."
"If the ADX indicates trending conditions, an exponential moving average (EMA) is used for defining trend direction."
"By default, the strategy employs the 14 period ADX and the 60 period EMA."
"In case the trend mode is spotted (ADX > 18), Short Exit signals are issued when: PZO values fall below the ""-60"" level and start to go up afterwards, or the price is above EMA (uptrend) and PZO is positive."
"In non-trending conditions (ADX < 18), these signals are issued when: having surpassed the ""-40"" level, the PZO falls below the ""-60"" level and starts to go up, or having surpassed the ""-40"" level, the PZO rises above zero while the price is above the EMA, or having crossed the ""-5"" level from above, the PZO fails to reach the ""-40"" level and rises above ""+15""."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the PZO and EMA are calculated.
` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the PZO and the ADX.
` ema length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMA.

HULL ## Technical Analysis # SentimentZoneOscillator ## Description The Sentiment Zone Oscillator (SZO) is a technical indicator which attempts to measure overall market sentiment (bullish or bearish) and marks overbought and oversold levels.
Calculation of this indicator is based on a premise that extremely bullish or bearish tendencies will eventually lead to trend reversal.
"In order to calculate the main plot, SZO finds the TEMA-smoothed sum of ""up"" bars minus sum of ""down"" bars on the specified period."
"An ""up"" bar has the price higher than that of the previous bar; a ""down"" bar, lower."
The average is then multiplied by 100 and divided by the length of the period.
The main plot is accompanied with dynamic overbought and oversold levels.
"In order to calculate these lines, the highest and lowest values of SZO, as well as its range, are found on a long-length period."
Overbought line is placed above the lowest value at a distance equal to the specified percentage of the SZO range.
Oversold line is placed below the highest value at the same distance.
"As SZO reaches new extremes, overbought and oversold lines are plotted at new levels."
"For information on Buy and Sell signals produced by the study, refer to the article on the Sentiment Zone strategy which adds Buy and Sell orders once these signals occur."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used in main plot calculation.

The Monkey Bars chart mode displays price action over the time period at specified price levels.
The data is accumulated on the chart's time period.
"When the time period is compound (e.g., 3 Months, 4 Years), it is divided into unit periods (e.g., 1 Month, 1 Year), and the data is accumulated on each one."
"The time period is split into aggregation periods, each one is assigned a digit."
"If a certain price or a price range is traded over a given aggregation period, it is assigned the corresponding digit."
"The first aggregation period is assigned 1, the next is assigned 2 - and so forth (up to 10, which is displayed as 0)."
"Note that if the number of aggregation periods exceeds 10, each next ten is also represented by a sequence of digits starting with 1 but shown in a different color."
The sequence of colors used to distinguish the tens is shown in the left upper corner of the chart.
"The longest row of Monkey Bars defines the price level, which was the most frequent during the specified time period; this level is called Monkey Bar (MB)."
"If there are several equally long rows that fit this description, the system chooses the closest to the price mid-range."
"Should the rows be at the same distance from the mid-range, the system recognizes the lower one as the Monkey Bar."
The price range surrounding the MB level where the specified percentage of the trading activity took place for the specified time period is called The Playground (PG).

## Sample The Monkey Bars Chart: Monkey Bars Expanded ## Technical Analysis # HHLLS ## Description The HHLLS (Higher High Lower Low Stochastic) study is a momentum-based technical indicator developed by Vitali Apirine.
"It consists of two stochastic lines, the calculation of which is inspired by StochasticFull and Williams%R ."
"The main purpose of HHLLS is to recognize trend behavior: emergence, corrections, and reversals."
"This can be done by spotting well-known signals: divergences, crossovers, and overbought/oversold conditions."
The HHLLS indicator is calculated as follows.
"First, the study calculates two values, HH and LL: _HH_ ."
"For bars with the high price greater than the previous high (otherwise 0): ` HH = (H c - H l )/(H h -H l ) ` , where H c is the current bars high price, H l and H h are the lowest and the highest high prices over a certain period."
_LL_ .
"For bars with the low price less than the previous low (otherwise 0): ` LL = (L h - L c )/(L h -L l ) ` , where L c is the current low price, L l and L h are the lowest and the highest low prices over a certain period."
"Both variables are then smoothed with a moving average, resulting in two main plots HHS and LLS."
"The values of these plots range from zero to 100, rarely reaching either boundary."
"Thus, by default, overbought and oversold levels are set at 60 and 10, respectively."
The divergence between the price and HHLLS plots might prove useful in recognition of trend reversals or corrections.
A bearish divergence is indicated when the price is trending up but HHS fails to confirm this move.
"Conversely, price making a new low when LLS goes up can be considered a bullish divergence."
Divergence of either type may need additional confirmation: a signal may prove stronger when one of the lines forms the divergence and the other crosses above the level of 50.
Another technique of using HHLLS is analyzing the behavior of the main plots in relation to each other.
"When HHS is rising while the LLS is making new lows, the price may be entering an uptrend."
The opposite situation may lead to emergence of a downtrend.
The crossovers of the two lines may also indicate important trading signals.
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period on which the highest high and lowest low prices are found and also the length for calculation of the moving average.
---|--- ` over bought ` | Defines the overbought level.
` signal line ` | Defines the signal level used in divergence confirmation.
` over sold ` | Defines the oversold level.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
## Plots ` HHS ` | The Higher High Stochastic plot.
---|--- ` LLS ` | The Lower Low Stochastic plot.
` OverBought ` | The overbought level.
` SignalLine ` | The signal level.
` OverSold ` | The oversold level.

HeikinAshiDiff HiLoActivator ## Technical Analysis # PriceSwing ## Description The Price Swing strategy is a swing trading technical indicator introduced by Domenico D'Errico.
This strategy adds entry and exit simulated orders when a swing (a rapid price move of either direction) of a specified type is detected.
The strategy recognizes four types of swing: Pivot High-Low.
"This is a basic pivot point detection method: an upswing is detected if the low price first falls below its previous value, but then rises."
"Conditions for the downswing are vice versa, based on the high price."
Bollinger Bands crossover.
An upswing is detected if the price crosses above the lower plot of the Bollinger Bands.
A downswing is detected when the price crosses below the upper plot of the Bollinger Bands.
RSI Crossover.
An upswing is detected if the RSI crosses above the oversold level (which is set by default to 40).
A downswing is detected when it crosses below the overbought level (the default value is 60).
RSI + Higher Low/Lower High.
An upswing is detected if the current low price is greater than its previous value while the RSI is below oversold.
A downswing is detected if the current high price is less than its previous value while the RSI is above overbought.
The strategy adds a simulated buy-to-open order every time the upswing is detected.
Sell-to-open simulated orders are added at downswings.
"Exits are provided when a specified period of time elapses, which defaults to 20 bars."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` swing type ` | Defines the type of swing to be looked for on chart.
` length ` | Defines the length with which the Bollinger Bands and the RSI will be calculated.
"` exit length ` | Defines the time period, completing which will have the strategy add a matching simulated exit order."
` deviations ` | Defines the deviation multiplier for the Bollinger Bands.
` overbought ` | Defines the overbought level.
` oversold ` | Defines the oversold level.
` average type ` | Defines the average type for the calculation of the Bollinger Bands and the RSI.

Returns the standard deviation between ` data ` and linear regression of ` data.
` ## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | Defines the variable for which the standard error is calculated.
length | 12 | Defines the period on which the standard error is calculated.
"## Example declare lower; input length = 10; plot StdError = StErr(close, length); The example calculates the standard error of close values for the defined number of bars."
"StDevAll StErrAll declare lower; input length = 10; plot StdError = StErr(close, length); ## Technical Analysis # SlowVSI ## Description The Slow Volume Strength Index (SVSI), designed by Vitali Apirine, is a momentum-based oscillator that shares the principles of the well-known Relative Strength Index (RSI) ."
SVSI can be considered a measure of change in buying and selling pressure.
The calculation of the SVSI involves applying the standard oscillator formula to values of slow volume strength (the ratio of average positive volume to average negative volume).
"In SVSI, volume is considered positive when the close is above its exponential moving average and negative when it is below."
"If the close price is equal to its average, the volume is considered equal to zero."
Absolute values of both positive and negative volumes are then subjected to Wilder's smoothing and the ratio of the smoothed values is transformed into an oscillator.
"Just like many other oscillators, SVSI has many applications: Default overbought and oversold levels for the oscillator are 80 and 20, respectively; Crossovers with the middle line and divergences might provide useful trading signals; SVSI can be also used for confirmation of another Mr. Apirine's oscillator, the Slow Relative Strength Index (SRSI) ."
## Input Parameters ` ema length ` | The period over which the exponential moving average is calculated.
---|--- ` vsi length ` | The period over which the Wilder's average is calculated.
` over bought ` | Defines the overbought level.
` over sold ` | Defines the oversold level.
## Plots ` SlowVSI ` | The Slow Volume Strength Index oscillator.
---|--- ` OverBought ` | The overbought level.
` MiddleLine ` | The middle line.
` OverSold ` | The oversold level.

SlowRSI The Slow Relative Strength Index is a version of the classic Relative Strength Index (RSI), ... and oversold levels for the oscillator are 80 and 20, respectively; with the middle line and divergences might provide useful trading signals; ## Technical Analysis # StErrAll ` StErrAll ( IDataHolder data, int length, int startDate, int startTime, double extendToLeft, double extendToRight); ` Default values: ` length: all chart ` ` startDate: 0 ` ` startTime: 0 ` ` extendToLeft: No ` ` extendToRight: No ` ## Description Returns the standard error of ` data ` around the regression line for the entire plot or for the interval of last bars defined by the ` length ` parameter."
The difference of thIS function from ` StErr ` is that the output result for the last bar is used for the whole interval calculated.
"If the ` length ` parameter is not specified, the function is calculated for the entire plot."
The ` startDate ` (specified in the YYYYMMDD format) and ` startTime ` (specified in the HHMM format) define the date and time for the starting point of linear regression.
These parameters override any value of the ` length ` if the ` startDate ` is non-zero.
"By default, the function will return ` Double.NaN ` at any moment in time outside the interval used for calculation of linear regression."
This behavior can be changed by using non-zero values of ` extendToLeft ` and ` extendToRight ` parameters.
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data | \- | Defines the variable for which the standard error is calculated.
"length | all chart | If specified, defines number of the last bars for which the curve is plotted, otherwise, the curve is plotted for the whole chart."
"startDate | 0 | If specified, defines the date of starting point for calculation of standard error, in the YYYYMMDD format."
"startTime | 0 | If specified, defines the time of starting point for calculation of standard error, in the YYYYMMDD format."
extendToLeft | No | Defines whether or not to extend the standard error curve to the left of the end point.
extendToRight | No | Defines whether or not to extend the standard error curve to the right of the end point.
## Example input price = close; def regression = InertiaAll(price); def stdError = StErrAll(price); plot UpperLine = regression + stdError; plot LowerLine = regression - stdError; The example draws the Standard Error Channel which is the linear regression channel spaced by a standard error.
The error channel is based on the price data for the last 30 bars.
StErr input price = close; def regression = InertiaAll(price); def stdError = StErrAll(price); plot UpperLine = regression + stdError; plot LowerLine = regression - stdError; ## Technical Analysis # FourDayBreakoutLE ## Description The Four-Day Breakout LE strategy is designed by Ken Calhoun.
The strategy adds a buy to open order if: 1\.
Close price is greater than its simple moving average.
2\.
The last four candles are all bullish.
3\.
Price rises by at least $0.50 above the high of the highest of these candles.
"The strategy is thus based on the assumption that when such a pattern appears on the chart, the pressure is on the buyers' side and the trend is likely to continue."
"Moving average length, the minimum number of candles in the pattern, and the minimum buy stop offset can all be customized in the input parameters."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` average length ` | The length with which the moving average is to be calculated.
` pattern length ` | The minimum number of candles in the pattern.
` breakout amount ` | The minimum price change after the pattern for the strategy to trigger.

The angle itself is calculated using the ATan function.
"ASin Ceil declare lower; input length = 3; def avg = Average(close, length); def height = avg - avg[length]; plot ""Angle, deg"" = ATan(height/length) * 180 / Double.Pi; ## Technical Analysis # VPNIndicator ## Description The Volume Positive Negative (VPN) indicator is an oscillator developed by Markos Katsanos."
Its main purpose is to detect possible high-volume breakouts.
"As opposed to setting new highs as potential breakout entries, VPN only does so after volume confirmation."
The VPN indicator is calculated as follows: 1.
The study takes into account two types of volume: positive and negative.
Positive volume is the volume related to a bar with typical price at least 1/10 ATR (average true range) greater than the typical price of the previous bar.
The opposite defines the negative volume.
"If the difference between the typical prices is less than 1/10 ATR, the volume of that bar is not taken into account."
2.
"After registering positive and negative volumes during the indicator period, the indicator calculates the sum of each volume over the same period."
3.
The difference between the total positive and total negative volumes is found.
4.
The result is divided by the total volume for the period and multiplied by 100.
5.
The result is smoothed with an exponential moving average.
"The resulting VPN plot is a line that oscillates in the -100 to +100 range; however, it tends to oscillate between -80 and +80."
Readings higher than the critical value (+10 by default) may indicate a possible bullish breakout.
Readings below the negative critical value may signify a possible bearish breakout.
"In addition, the indicator displays a moving average of the VPN plot (simple moving average by default)."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The indicator period.
` ema length ` | The length of the exponential moving average to smooth the result with.
` average length ` | The length of the average used in the calculation of the plot VPNAvg.
` factor ` | The factor to multiply ATR by when calculating the positive/negative volume.
` critical value ` | Readings higher than this value indicate a possible bullish breakout.
Readings lower than the opposite of this value indicate a possible bearish breakout.
"` average type ` | The type of the moving average to be used in the calculation of the VPNAvg plot: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` VPN ` | The Volume Positive Negative (VPN) indicator plot.

VossPredictiveFilter VWAP plot is a line that oscillates in the -100 to +100 range; ## Technical Analysis # SVEPivots ## Description The SVEPivots study is a support/resistance technical indicator developed by Sylvain Vervoort that is based upon the observation that uptrend and downtrend price swings are quite often of almost equal lengths.
The indicator estimates future price targets by calculating the measured move (price projection based on the previous swing).
"By default, the SVEPivots indicator calculates daily pivot levels, however, these can be calculated on any standard aggregation period."
"The daily pivot levels are defined by price values of the previous day, namely, high, low, and close."
"Using these values, the study projects seven intraday price targets: three support levels, three resistance levels, and a pivot point level."
"These levels are calculated using the following formulas (PH, PL, and PC stand for previous day's high, low, and close price, respectively): ` PP = (PH + PL + PC) / 3; ` ` R1 = 2 PP - PL; ` ` R2 = PP + (PH - PL); ` ` R3 = 2 PP + (PH - 2 PL); ` ` S1 = 2 PP - PH; ` ` S2 = PP - (PH - PL); ` ` S3 = 2 PP - (2 PH - PL)."
"` In addition, the following reference levels are calculated: Resistance Mean value 1: The midline between the pivot point and the first resistance level Support Mean value 1: The midline between the pivot point and the first support level Resistance Mean value 2: The midline between the first and the second resistance levels Support Mean value 2: The midline between the first and the second support levels Resistance Mean value 3: The midline between the the second and the third resistance levels Support Mean value 3: The midline between the second and the third support levels Previous low: The previous day's (or period's) low price Previous high: The previous day's (or period's) high price ## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` aggregation period ` | The period on which the pivot point and support/resistance levels are calculated."

Drawings are designed to retain a starting point and an ending point.
"These points are based off of time and price, the drawing simply connects the points."
"A trend line for example, has a slope associated with it and the angle of the line is dependent on how much space is in between the start and end points you select for that line."
"In other words, the angle of the line will vary due to the changing amount of space in between the points when switching through different aggregations."
## Technical Analysis # TickSize ` TickSize ( String symbol); ` Default values: ` symbol: getSymbol() ` ## Description Returns the minimum possible tick size for the specified symbol.
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- symbol | current symbol | Defines symbol for which the tick size is returned.
## Example input numberOfTicks = 3; plot OverBought = Highest(high)[1] + numberOfTicks TickSize(); plot OverSold = Lowest(low)[1] - numberOfTicks TickSize(); plot BreakOut = if Close >= OverBought then Close else if Close <= OverSold then Close else Double.NaN; Breakout.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.POINTS); Breakout.SetLineWeight(3); Breakout.HideBubble(); Initially the example draws the ` OverBought ` and ` OverSold ` plots.
The ` OverBought ` plot is calculated by adding the given number of ticks to the highest price for the last 12 bars starting from previous bar.
The ` OverSold ` plot is calculated the same way but by subtracting the ticks from the lowest price.
If the ` close ` price is out of the area of the first two plots the code displays the ` BreakOut ` plot.
If TickValue input numberOfTicks = 3; plot OverBought = Highest(high)[1] + numberOfTicks * TickSize(); plot OverSold = Lowest(low)[1] - numberOfTicks * TickSize(); plot BreakOut = if Close >= OverBought then Close else if Close <= OverSold then Close else Double.NaN; ## How to thinkorswim # FX Currency Map The FX Currency Map is a thinkorswim gadget that allows you to quickly and easily check the dynamics of currency pairs.
"Like all other gadgets, the FX Currency Map can be displayed as a section of the left sidebar or a separate window (see the Left Sidebar article for details)."
The first thing you need to do when using the FX Currency map is specify the quote currency (also known as counter currency) in the currency toggle located in the gadget header.
This is the currency against which the map will be built.
"Basically speaking, the map illustrates the comparison of available currencies with the one you specified in the toggle."
"On top of the map, there is a display of base currencies."
"Those are major currencies from around the world, each assigned a proper map section, spanning from the U.S. dollar on the left to the New Zealand dollar on the right."
Each of the base currencies is compared with the quote currency and the result of the comparison is displayed as a histogram.
Note that this histogram is plotted based on the base-to-quote currency ratio which is not necessarily equal to the FX pair ratio.
Red columns directed downwards signify that at this very moment it takes less quote currency to buy the base currency than it did this morning.
Green columns directed upwards mean exactly the opposite.
Hovering the mouse over currency sections will bring up a pop-up window where you can see the following: \- The full symbol of the currency pair.

"When activated, it modifies the Delta of your positions based on the Beta coefficient (the relation of the volatility of a stock to that of another stock or index)."
"Overview For example, a stock's volatility can be compared to an indexs volatility."
"If a stock tends to move a similar percentage to an index's percent move, then that stock will have a beta of 1 when compared to the index."
"However, if a stock tends to move a higher percentage than the index's percent move, that stock's beta will be higher than 1 when compared to the index."
"Conversely, if a stock's percent move is less than index's, that stock's beta will be lower than 1 when compared to the index."
The process of comparing volatility of a stock and an index is called beta weighting.
You can also use the same process to beta weight one stock's volatility relative to another stock.
You may notice that the positions in the Activity and Positions sections tend to have different Delta or Net Shares.
Delta is defined as an approximation of the change in the price of an option relative to a change in the price of the underlying stock when all other factors are held constant.
"However, each stock has a different price and different volatility making it difficult to assess overall risk on the portfolio."
How to activate Beta weighting Beta weighting converts the Delta or Net Shares of the position relative to the selected symbol.
To activate beta weighting: 1.
Activate the Beta weighting checkbox above your positions.
2.
"In the symbol selector, type in the symbol or an index you would like to beta weight your positions against."
Press Enter.
Delta for each symbol is now updated to reflect the Beta weighting.
3.
"If you apply beta weighting and a symbol in your account returns N/A, contact us via the Help tab, Live Support, email, chat, or phone."
"Request beta weighting for the symbol, and once the process is complete, the N/A will become a beta weighted number for that symbol."

"RegularTradingEnd SecondsFromTime def rth = (RegularTradingEnd(GetYYYYMMDD()) - RegularTradingStart(GetYYYYMMDD())) / AggregationPeriod.HOUR; yes, ""RTH duration (hrs): "" + rth); ## Technical Analysis # Falling Wedge The Falling Wedge pattern is the opposite of the Rising Wedge : it is defined by two trendlines drawn through peaks and bottoms, both headed downward."
It takes at least five reversals (two for one trendline and three for the other) to form a good Falling Wedge pattern.
"Both Rising and Falling wedges show great versatility: they could appear as consolidation patterns with the trend, or against the trend, or even as topping patterns after a climax."
"Statistically, the latter are less often to occur but seem more striking than consolidation."
"When following an uptrend, the Falling Wedge pattern shows gradual decline in price which, in most cases, will end up breaking through the upper line, thus continuing the preceding trend."
Downward breakouts are much less expected: one study shows that virtually all breakouts happen to the upside and another study states that at least two thirds do.
"Thus, the Falling Wedge is generally regarded as a bullish pattern."
"Falling Wedges often come after a climax trough (sometimes called a ""panic""), a sudden reversal of an uptrend, often on heavy volume."
"In this case, price within the Falling Wedge is usually not expected to fall below the panic value, ending up in breaking through the upper trendline."
"During the pattern formation, volume is most likely to fall; however, better performance is expected in wedges with high volume at the breakout point."
Gaps before the breakout are also said to improve the performance.
"The estimated performance of the Falling Wedge is a bit higher than that of the rising one, but still questionable."
"Nonetheless, the results for the non- classical combination of Falling Wedge in downtrend with a downward breakout seems to work surprisingly better than all other wedge combinations; as one can expect, they are rare to find."
The wedge width can also be a performance factor: wider wedges seem to be more reliable than the narrow ones.

THREE_DAYS WEEK def agg = AggregationPeriod.FOUR_DAYS; plot data = close(period = agg); ## Technical Analysis # VWMABreakouts ## Description The VWMA Breakouts strategy is a moving average-based breakout indicator designed by Ken Calhoun for swing trading in volatile markets.
Its main purpose is to combine the beneficial properties of a simple moving average and a volume-weighted one.
"As the name implies, the volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) assigns different weights to the close price when calculating the average; greater weights being assigned to close price readings that have shown higher volume."
"The indicator consists of two lines: an SMA of the close price, which acts as a trendline, and a VWMA line, being a signal line."
"When the price rises on high volume, the VWMA line is likely to be seen moving further away from the SMA, which may be regarded as a signal for uptrend continuation."
Simulated trade signals are given upon crossovers of the VWMA and the SMA.
"When the VWMA crosses above the SMA, a buy to open signal is indicated."
"When it falls back below the SMA, a sell to close signal is given."
"By default, a 50-period VWMA and a 70-period SMA lines are calculated; these values are suggested by the author for use on 15-day 15-minute charts."
These values as well as the type of the moving average to be used as the trendline can be modified in the input parameters.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` vwma length ` | The length of the volume-weighted moving average.
` ma length ` | The length of the moving average to be used as the trendline.
` average type ` | The type of the moving average to be used as the trendline.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` VWMA ` | The plot of the signal volume-weighted moving average.

"If you specify ` length ` , the approximation is applied only for the last ` length ` bars of the plot, otherwise the approximation is applied for the entire plot and it is calculated based on all bars from the plot."
See the ` Inertia ` function for more information.
The ` startDate ` (specified in the YYYYMMDD format) and ` startTime ` (specified in the HHMM format) define the date and time for the starting point of linear regression.
These parameters override any value of the ` length ` if the ` startDate ` is non-zero.
"By default, the function will return ` Double.NaN ` at any moment in time outside the interval used for calculation of linear regression."
This behavior can be changed by using non-zero values of ` extendToLeft ` and ` extendToRight ` parameters.

Long Entry signal is generated when TAC_DIPlus clusters below level 10 and its lower line reaches level 5 while TAC_ADX cluster turns down from level 70.
Short Entry signal is generated when TAC_DIMinus clusters below level 10 and its lower line reaches level 5 while TAC_ADX cluster turns down from level 70.
Main signals are accompanied with additional ones indicating that a trend might be emerging or terminating.
Signal of possible trend start is given when TAC_ADX cluster turns up from below 30; a stronger version of this signal occurs when the cluster turns up from below 20.
"The other signal suggests trend termination, it is generated when TAC_ADX cluster turns up from below 70."

"If necessary, modify these filters."
The total number of matches is displayed live on the right.
"Note that even though each filter may display a certain number of matches in pre-scan, the actual scan may return no results, as the stock needs to match all the specified criteria."
3.
"If necessary, add more filters to the scan by clicking the buttons on above the filters area."
You can use up to 25 filters in a single scan and only one pattern filter is allowed.
"To remove a filter, click X on its right."

"It is based on the eponymous technical indicator , which calculates the strength of a security relative to another security or index."
The strategy adds a buy to open simulated order when RSMK crosses above the zero level (which signifies that the primary security starts to outperform the secondary one).
This simulated order is automatically closed by an opposite simulated order after a specified number of bars elapses since the entry.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` correlation with security ` | The security or index to compare the primary symbol with.
` rs length ` | The period to calculate the relative strength for.
` average length ` | The length of the exponential moving average.

"## Calendar Spread (Time Spread) An option position composed of either only calls or only puts, with the purchase or sale of an option with a nearby expiration offset by the purchase or sale of an option with the same strike price, but a more distant expiration."
The options are on the same stock and have the same strike price.
The quantity of long options and the quantity of short options net to zero.
"For example, long the AUG/NOV 65 call calendar spread is short 1 August 65 call and long 1 November 65 call."
## Called Away The term used when the seller of a call option is obligated to deliver the underlying stock to the buyer of the call at the strike price of the call option.
"## Call Option A call option gives the owner of the call the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying stock at the option's strike price."
"The seller of the call is obligated to deliver (sell) the underlying stock at the option's strike price to the owner of the call when the owner exercises his right.. ## Call Writer An investor who receives a premium for selling a call and takes on, for a specified time period, the obligation to sell the underlying security at a specified price at the call buyer's discretion."
## Canceled Order An order to buy or sell stock or options that is canceled before it has been executed.
"Generally, it is easier to cancel a limit order than a market order."
A limit order can be canceled at any time as long as it has not been executed.
Market orders can get executed so quickly that it is usually impossible to cancel them.
TD Ameritrade will not accept an order cancellation for a market order.
## Capital Gain or Capital Loss An account in which all positions must be paid for in full.
Naked short calls or short stocks are not allowed in a cash account.
## Carry/Carrying Charge Interest is charged on any money borrowed to finance a position of stocks or options.
The interest cost of financing the position is known as the carry.
## Cash Account An account in which all positions must be paid for in full.
Naked short calls or short stocks are not allowed in a cash account.
"## Cash Market Generally referred to regarding futures markets, the cash market is where transactions are made in the commodity or instrument underlying the future."
"For example, there are cash markets in physical commodities such as grains and livestock, metals, and crude oil, financial instruments such as U.S. Treasury Bonds and Eurodollars, as well as foreign currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar."
"As it relates to futures on stock indices, the cash market is the aggregate market value of the stocks making up the stock index."
"## Cash Settled Option An option that delivers a cash amount, as opposed to the underlying stock or futures contracts such as with options on stocks or futures, when exercised."
The amount of cash delivered is determined by the difference between the option strike price and the value of the underlying index or security.
"In the U.S., stock index options on the OEX and SPX are cash settled options."
## Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) The Chicago Board Options Exchange is currently (2000) the largest option exchange in the U.S.
"Formed in 1973, the CBOE pioneered ""listed options"" with standardized contracts."
Equity and index options are traded at the CBOE.
"## Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Founded in 1848 with 82 original members, today the CBOT is the one of the largest futures and options exchanges in the world."
It is known for its grain and U.S. Treasury Bond futures.
Futures and futures options are traded at the CBOT.
"## Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Originally formed in 1874 as the Chicago Produce Exchange, where products such as butter, eggs, and poultry were traded, the CME is now one of the biggest futures and options exchanges in the world."
"The CME trades futures on stock indices, foreign currencies, livestock, and Eurodollars."
Futures and futures options are traded at the CME.
## Class of Options (Options Class) Options of the same type either all calls or all puts on the same underlying security.
"## Clear/Clearing The process by which orders are accounted for and matched, and funds transferred."
## Clearing Broker-Dealer A broker-dealer that clears its own trades as well as those of introducing brokers.
"## Clearing House An agency connected with an exchange through which all stock and option transactions are reconciled, settled, guaranteed, and later either offset or fulfilled through delivery of the stock and through which payments are made."
"It may be a separate corporation, rather than a division of the exchange itself."
"## Clearing Member Clearing members of U.S. exchanges accept responsibility for all trades cleared through them, and share secondary responsibility for the liquidity of the exchanges' clearing operation."
Clearing members earn commissions for clearing their clients' trades.
Clearing members must meet minimum capital requirements.
## Client Any person or entity that opens a trading account with a broker-dealer.
"The client may be classified in terms of account ownership, payment methods, trading authorization or types of securities traded."
"## Close (C), The The time at which trading on a stock or option ends for the day."
"In reference to the O,H,L,C ""C"" represents the closing price of the regular trading session."
## Closing Price The price of a stock or option at the last transaction of the regular trading session.
## Closing Purchase A transaction in which a person who had initially sold short a stock or option exits or closes his short position by buying back the stock or option.
"## Closing Range The range of high and low prices, or bid and ask prices, recorded during the close (the final closing minutes of the trading day)."
"## Closing Transaction A transaction in which a person who had initially bought or sold stock, futures or options exits or closes (liquidates) his position by selling his long stock, futures or options or buying back his short stock, futures or options."
"## Combo Often another term for synthetic stock, a combo is an option position composed of calls and puts on the same stock, same expiration, and typically the same strike price."
The quantity of long options and the quantity of short options nets to zero.
Buying a combo is buying synthetic stock; selling a combo is selling synthetic stock.
"For example, a long 60 combo is long 160 call and short 160 put."
"Sometimes, combo is used to describe options at two different strikes, in which case it would not be synthetic stock."
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
## Commission A one-time fee that may be charged by a broker to a client when the clients stock or options trade is executed through the brokerage firm.
TD Ameritrade's commission for trades is $0.00.
"## Condor Spread An option position composed of either all calls or all puts (with the exception of an iron condor), with long options and short options at four different strikes."
"The options are all on the same stock and of the same expiration, with the quantity of long options and the quantity of short options netting to zero."
"Generally, the strikes are equidistant from each other, but if the strikes are not equidistant, the spread is called a pterodactyl."
"For example, a long 50/55/60/65 call condor is long 150 call, short 155 call, short 160 call, and long 165 call."
In a long (short) condor the highest and lowest strikes are both long (short) while the two middle strikes are both short (long).
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
"## Confirmation Statement After a stock or options transaction has taken place, the brokerage firm must issue a statement to the client."
"The statement contains the name of the underlying stock, the number of shares or option contracts bought or sold and the prices at which the transactions occurred."
## Consolidated Tape The ticker reporting transactions of NYSE listed stocks that take place on the NYSE or any of the other regional stock exchanges.
## Contango The inverse of backwardation.
When the futures price is above the spot price at expiration.
"## Contingency Order When you place a stock or options order you can choose to place contingencies on that order, meaning that the order will be filled only when a specific event has occurred."
"For example, a contingency order might be, ""Buy 10 XYZ 80 calls at the market if XYZ stock trades above 75""."
## Contract The basic unit of trading for options.
"An option, whether it's a put or a call, is an agreement between two parties (the buyer and the seller) to abide by the terms of the option contract as defined by an exchange."
## Contract Month Generally used to describe the month in which an option contract expires.
## Contract Size The number of shares of the underlying stock that an options contract would deliver if exercised.
"Contract sizes for equity options in the U.S. are generally 100 shares, unless the contract size has been adjusted for a split, merger, or spin-off."
"For example, if you are long 1 XYZ 50 call with a contract size of 100 and you exercise that call, you will get 100 shares of XYZ for a price of $50 per share."
TD Ameritrade incorporates the contract size in the calculation of your delta and gamma.
"## Conversion (Option's Position) A position of long stock, short a call, and long a put (with the call and put having the same strike price, expiration date, and underlying stock)."
"The short call and long put acts very much like short stock, thus acting as a hedge to the long stock."
"So, a conversion has a very small delta."
A conversion is a way to exploit mispricings in carrying costs.
## Correction A temporary reversal of direction of the overall trend of a particular stock or the market in general.
"## Cost Basis The original price paid for a stock or option, plus any commissions or fees."
It is used to determine capital gains or losses when the stock or option is sold.
## Cover Frequently used to describe the purchase of an option or stock to exit or close an existing short position.
## Covered-Return An annualized projected return of a covered position where options are sold for cash at the expense of limiting maximum gain on the underlying position.
Covered return = call mark in the money amount / stock price 365/calendar days to expiration.
"## Covered Write or Covered Call or Put/Covered Call or Put Writing (Selling) An option strategy composed of a short call option and long stock, or a short put option and short stock."
"For example, selling (writing) 2 XYZ calls while owning 200 shares of XYZ stock is a covered call position."
"## Covered Writer (Seller) Someone who sells or ""writes"" an option is considered to have a ""covered"" position when the seller of the option holds a position in the underlying stock that offsets the risk of the short option."
"For example, a short put option is covered by a short position in the underlying stock, and a short call option is covered by a long position in the underlying stock."
"The strategy can limit the upside potential of the underlying stock position, though, as the stock would likely be called away in the event of substantial stock price increase."
## Credit An increase in the cash balance of an account resulting from either a deposit or a transaction.
"As it relates to option orders, a credit is how much the premium collected from selling options exceeds the premium paid for buying options."
## Credit Balance (CR) This is the money the broker owes the client after all commitments have been paid for in full.
"The money could come after a sale of securities, or simply be cash in the client's account."
## Credit Spread Any option spread where you collect a credit when the spread order is filled.
The credit occurs when the amount of premium received for the option sold exceeds the premium paid for the option purchased.
"## Crossed Market A situation that occurs on multiple-listed stock and options, where the highest bid price for a stock or option on one exchange is higher than the lowest ask price for that same stock or option on another exchange."
## Crossing Orders The practice of using one client's orders to fill a second client's order for the same security on the opposite side of the market.
"For this to occur each order must be first offered on the exchange floor; if there are no takers, the broker may cross the orders usually at a price somewhere in between the existing bid and ask prices."
## Current Market Value (CMV) The current worth of the securities in an account.

EARNINGS ## Technical Analysis # ForecastOscillator ## Description The Forecast Oscillator compares actual price with the value returned by the Time Series Forecast study.
It is calculated as percentage ratio of the difference between the Close price and previous bar's Time Series Forecast value to the Close price.
"Positive values of the oscillator suggest that price has been underestimated by Time Series Forecast, and negative values indicate that actual price is lower than the predicted one."
The main study plot is accompanied with SMA to look for oscillator reversals.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the Time Series Forecast value.
` signal ma ` | The number of bars used to calculate the average.

"ForceIndex FourierSeriesIndicator ## Technical Analysis # Logical ## Description The following logical operators are available in thinkScript: Operator | Description ---|--- ` is true ` | logical value ` !, is false ` | logical NOT ` and, && ` | logical AND ` or ` | logical OR Logical operators can be applied only to numeric data."
Zero(0) is interpreted as a ` false ` value; all other values are interpreted as a ` true ` value.
"Therefore, expression ` x is true ` returns ` true ` when ` x ` is non-zero, and ` false ` when ` x ` is zero."
Consider the following rules when using the logical operators: Logical NOT is ` true ` when the argument is ` false ` .
"For some expression ` x ` , it can be written as ` !x ` or ` x is false ` ."
Logical AND is ` true ` when both arguments are ` true ` .
Logical OR is ` true ` when at least one argument is ` true ` .
"For examples of usage of ` is true ` and ` is false ` operators, refer to the ` is ` reserved word article."
## Example 1 plot LocalMinimum = low < low[1] and low < low[-1]; LocalMinimum.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_UP); Highlights local minumums of the lowest price.

It has the same calculation basis as the Rate Of Change (ROC) oscillator: the percentage change of a security or index price momentum to its past value.
"However, instead of outputting a single line, ROCWB calculates ROC-based deviation bands that act as overbought and oversold levels."
A moving average of ROC is also calculated for additional information.
"Generally, positive readings of ROC indicate an uptrend, and negative readings indicate a downtrend."
High volatility levels tend to result in band widening.
"Conversely, band contraction may signify that volatility is decreasing."
"When the average ROC breaks out of the upper band, the security or index may be overbought."
ROC average readings below the lower band indicate that the security or index may be oversold.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The type of price to be used in calculations.
` roc length ` | The length to calculate the rate of change with.
` average length ` | The length to calculate the moving average with.
` rms length ` | The length to calculate root mean square with.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` ROCAvg ` | The average Rate Of Change plot.
` +RMS ` | The upper Rate Of Change deviation band.
` -RMS ` | The lower Rate Of Change deviation band.

## Example declare lower; def close1 = First(close); plot Data = (close - close1) / close1 100; The code calculates the close price percentage move on the analogy of the Percentage View mode for charts.
In this example the parameter expression for the first function is ` close ` .
This means that the ` close1 ` variable always holds close for the first bar.
"EntryPrice FPL declare lower; def close1 = First(close); plot Data = (close - close1) / close1 * 100; ## Technical Analysis # GetAveragePrice ` GetAveragePrice ( Symbol symbol); ` Default values: ` symbol: current symbol ` ## Description Returns the average trade price for a specified instrument, for the currently selected account."
"Note: there are certain limitations of usage of Portfolio functions; for more information on that, refer to the Portfolio functions index page."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- symbol | current symbol | Defines the instrument for which the average price will be returned.
## Example declare lower; def qty = GetQuantity(); def openCost = qty GetAveragePrice(); def netLiq = qty close; plot ManualOpenPL = netLiq - openCost; plot AutoOpenPL = GetOpenPL(); This example script uses the ` GetAveragePrice ` function along with ` GetQuantity ` to manually calculate the Open Profit/Loss value.
The resulting plot is shown with its automatic version calculated using the ` GetOpenPL ` function.
The calculation is based on the execution price.
Note that manual calculation of Open Profit/Loss used in this script is only valid for symbols with a dollar value equal to 1.
"For instruments that have a different dollar value, ` NetLiq ` and ` OpenCost ` formulas are to be multiplied by it."

Gap Up is a combination of bars where the current Low is higher than the previous bar's High.
"In the event of Gap Up, the Long Entry signal is generated for the next bar."
GapReversalLE GoldenCrossBreakouts ## Technical Analysis # TAC_ADX ## Description The TAC_ADX study is a technical indicator which attempts to provide start and end points of strong trend based on clusters of ADX plots.
"According to BC Low's article ""Identify the Start of a Trend with DMI"", this indicator should be used along with TAC_DIPlus and TAC_DIMinus to get the full picture of trending conditions."
"Prefix ""TAC"" stands for ""Triple ADX Cluster"" as all three indicators used in BC Low's system are plotted three times using different lengths."
Three lines of TAC_ADX turning up after converging below the level of 30 might indicate the start of the trend.
"On the other hand, turning down above the level of 70 might suggest a termination or a retracement."
A stronger signal for the trend start might be given if the level of 20 is used instead.
"In an exceptionally strong trend, the termination is more likely to happen if clustering occurs above the level of 90."
"Note that TAC_ADX is also used with TAC_DIPlus and TAC_DIMinus in order to identify market bottoms and tops, respectively."
"For more information on that, refer to the corresponding articles."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` adx length1 ` | The number of bars used to calculate the first ADX plot; normally the lowest of the three.
` adx length2 ` | The number of bars used to calculate the second ADX plot; normally the middle one.
` adx length3 ` | The number of bars used to calculate the third ADX plot; normally the highest of the three.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

TAC_DIMinus bars used to calculate the first ADX plot; bars used to calculate the second ADX plot; bars used to calculate the third ADX plot; ## Technical Analysis # 3 Point Extension 3 Point Extension is a Fibonacci pattern.
"It is defined by three points A, B, and C, of which: For a bearish 3 Point Extension, points A and are tops of the price plot, and B is a bottom between them."
"For a bullish 3 Point Extension, points A and are bottoms of the price plot, and B is a top between them."
A bearish 3 Point Extension is recognized if: The segment AB is a retracement to the bottom followed by an uptrend segment BC.
The price difference between A and B is about 61.8% of the price difference between C and B.
A bullish 3 Point extension is recognized if: The segment AB is a drive to the top followed by a downtrend segment BC.
"The price difference between B and A is about 61.8% of the price difference between B and C. When the pattern is complete, it may suggest that the price is likely to find support or resistance at one of the Fibonacci levels calculated based on the price level of point C. Note that the Fibonacci levels are only displayed for the last Fibonacci pattern on the chart."

## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- yyyyMmDd | \- | Defines the day whose number is returned.
## Example input first_day = 10; input last_day = 20; plot Data = if GetDayofMonth(GetYyyyMmDd()) between first_day and last_day then close else double.NaN; Displays the close price only for days of month falling into a specified interval.
GetDay GetDayOfWeek input first_day = 10; input last_day = 20; plot Data = if GetDayofMonth(GetYyyyMmDd()) between first_day and last_day then close else double.NaN; ## Technical Analysis # FIR_TriangleWeighting ## Description The FIR (finite impulse response) Triangle Weighting is an indicator that filters the data to find the balance between the simple moving average's filtering capability and its lagging.
This filter uses a weighting system for data points: weights are linearly increased through halfway of the indicator length and linearly decreased afterwards.
"This way, most of the weight is given to data around the middle of the indicator's length, and least of the weight is given to data points at the beginning and the end of it."
The calculation of this filter is consistent with the formula of the Triangular window function.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to which the FIR Triangle Weighting is to be applied.
` length ` | The length of the FIR Triangle Weighting filter.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` TriangleWeighting ` | The FIR Triangle Weighting plot.

FIR_Hann FisherTransform ## Technical Analysis # then ## Syntax See the ` if ` reserved word article.
## Description This reserved word is used to specify an action to be performed when the ` if ` condition is satisfied.
It is used only in combination with ` if-expression ` or ` if-statement ` .
"Note that in ` if-statement ` , the ""then"" block can be omitted."
than to ## Technical Analysis # def ## Syntax ` def <variable_name>=<expression>; ` or ` def <variable_name>; ` ` <variable_name>=<expression>; ` ## Description Defines a variable you would like to work with.
## Example 1.
"Non-recursive usage def base = Average(close, 12); plot UpperBand = base 1.1; plot LowerBand = base 0.9; This example shows a simplified SMAEnvelope study, where the ` def ` reserved word is used to define the base."
"The rationale of defining this variable is to avoid double calculations (increase performance) in UpperBand and LowerBand plots, because ` def ` variable values are cached (by means of increasing memory usage)."
You can separate the variable definition from its value assignment.
"Consider the following example: declare lower; input index = {default SPX, ""Nasdaq Composite"", NDX}; def data; switch (index) { case SPX: data = close(""SPX""); case ""Nasdaq Composite"": data = close(""COMP""); case NDX: data = close(""NDX""); } plot IndexCorrelation = Correlation(close, data, 10); This example script plots the correlation between the current instrument's data and the data of a specified index."
Values of the ` data ` variable are controlled by the selected ` index ` input parameter via the switch command.
## Example 2.
"Recursive usage def C = C[1] + volume; plot CumulativeVolume = C; This example script illustrates how ` def ` variable ""C"" references its own historical values, i.e., ""C"" designates a recursive variable."
"Here, the plot will represent cumulative volume starting from the beginning of time period."
## Example 3.
"Non-recursive and recursive enumerations You can define a variable as having a limited number of possible values (in which case this variable is called enumeration): def trend = {default bullish, bearish}; if close > Average(close, 10) { trend = trend.bullish; } else { trend = trend.bearish; } AssignBackgroundColor(if trend == trend.bullish then Color.UPTICK else if trend == trend.bearish then Color.DOWNTICK else Color.CURRENT); This example script defines variable ` trend ` as having two possible values: bullish or bearish."
The first value is assigned to this variable when the Close price is greater than its 10 period simple moving average and the second value otherwise.
"This variable controls the color of the background: it is filled with Uptick color when the value is ""bullish"" and Downtick otherwise."
Note that enumerations can only use string values.
"The example above shows non-recursive usage of enumerations, however, these can be used recursively: def a = {default neutral, up, down}; ### line 1: declaration of a def enumeration a = if (close == close[1]) then a.neutral ### line 2: assignment of the values else if (close > close[1]) then a.up else if (close < close[1]) then a.down else a[1]; plot q; ### line 6: plot declaration switch (a) { ### line 7: switch statement case up: q = low; case down: q = high; case neutral: q = close; } The first line of the script is a declaration of a def enumeration ` a ` having values ` neutral ` , ` up ` , and ` down ` ."
The ` default ` keyword indicates the default value of the enumeration.
"If a value is not assigned to the declared variable, it will always be equal to its default neutral value."
"The value is assigned to the variable in the second line, followed by plot declaration."
Enumerations can only have one assignment statement.
Command ` switch ` defines what should be plotted based on the value of variable ` a ` .
Note that enumerations are not interchangeable.
This means that you cannot assign same values to two different enumerations.
"Note also that both sides of statements in the enumeration assignment should be of the same type: def a = {q, w, e, default r, t, y}; def b = {q, w, e, default r, t, y}; a = a.q; b = b.q; plot z = a[1] == a.q; plot x = a == z; ### error in this line plot y = a != if (1==2) then a else a.q; plot w = if (1==2) then a else a.q != if (1==2) then b else b.q; ### error in this line declare default def <variable_name>=<expression>; def <variable_name>; def base = Average(close, 12); plot UpperBand = base * 1.1; plot LowerBand = base * 0.9; declare lower; input index = {default SPX, ""Nasdaq Composite"", NDX}; def data; plot IndexCorrelation = Correlation(close, data, 10); def C = C[1] + volume; plot CumulativeVolume = C; def trend = {default bullish, bearish}; if trend == trend.bullish then Color.UPTICK else if trend == trend.bearish then Color.DOWNTICK else Color.CURRENT); def a = {default neutral, up, down}; else a[1]; plot q; def a = {q, w, e, default r, t, y}; def b = {q, w, e, default r, t, y}; plot z = a[1] == a.q; plot x = a == z; plot y = a != if (1==2) then a else a.q; plot w = if (1==2) then a else a.q != if (1==2) then b else b.q; 1 2 3 ## How to thinkorswim # Monitor The Monitor tab is the primary location where your trading activity is tracked."

"By smoothing out noisy price data and singling out a cyclic component within it, the indicator can be used for analysis of cyclic reversals, which could potentially signal trading opportunities."
The calculation of the RocketRSI is as follows: A close price change ( momentum ) from a past value is found for each bar.
The offset between the current and the past price is constant.
The values found are run through the SuperSmootherFilter to eliminate the noise.
The algebraic sum of one-bar changes in the filtered values is divided by the sum of absolute values of the same changes.
The output of this step is limited to be in the range from -0.999 to +0.999.
The result is run through the Fisher transform to provide a wave-like output.
"If there is a dominant cycle in the input data and the lengths are set correctly, the analysis of peaks and troughs of the output wave may provide valuable sell and buy signals."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | Defines the period on which the Rocket RSI is calculated.
` cutoff length ` | Defines the length of the SuperSmootherFilter.
Data cycles with periods less than this values are eliminated.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` RocketRSI ` | The Rocket RSI study plot.

Portfolio Margin Option Chain Basics ## Technical Analysis # SVEPivots ## Description The SVEPivots study is a support/resistance technical indicator developed by Sylvain Vervoort that is based upon the observation that uptrend and downtrend price swings are quite often of almost equal lengths.
The indicator estimates future price targets by calculating the measured move (price projection based on the previous swing).
"By default, the SVEPivots indicator calculates daily pivot levels, however, these can be calculated on any standard aggregation period."
"The daily pivot levels are defined by price values of the previous day, namely, high, low, and close."
"Using these values, the study projects seven intraday price targets: three support levels, three resistance levels, and a pivot point level."
"These levels are calculated using the following formulas (PH, PL, and PC stand for previous day's high, low, and close price, respectively): ` PP = (PH + PL + PC) / 3; ` ` R1 = 2 PP - PL; ` ` R2 = PP + (PH - PL); ` ` R3 = 2 PP + (PH - 2 PL); ` ` S1 = 2 PP - PH; ` ` S2 = PP - (PH - PL); ` ` S3 = 2 PP - (2 PH - PL)."
"` In addition, the following reference levels are calculated: Resistance Mean value 1: The midline between the pivot point and the first resistance level Support Mean value 1: The midline between the pivot point and the first support level Resistance Mean value 2: The midline between the first and the second resistance levels Support Mean value 2: The midline between the first and the second support levels Resistance Mean value 3: The midline between the the second and the third resistance levels Support Mean value 3: The midline between the second and the third support levels Previous low: The previous day's (or period's) low price Previous high: The previous day's (or period's) high price ## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` aggregation period ` | The period on which the pivot point and support/resistance levels are calculated."

Two main plots compile the oscillator: Stochastic and IFT.
Stochastic plot values are derived by applying the basic Stochastic formula to the rainbow-averaged price data in order to reduce whipsaws.
The main idea of rainbow averaging is taking 10 WMAs of Close price and applying a transformed weighted average to them.
"The other plot, IFT, represents values derived after applying the Inverse Fisher Transform to values of the Stochastic plot."
Inverse Fisher Transform is calculated using the formula: Note that this formula differs from standard IFT: coefficients 50 and 1 are involved so that the [-1; 1] range is converted to [0; 100].
"In order to find buying and selling opportunities, use the IFT plot in combination with auxiliary overbought and oversold levels."

"Based upon the observation that the RSI strategy tends to overreact to minor changes in long trend conditions, this updated version introduces a trend filter."
This strategy detects existence of a trend and only reacts if the trend is strong enough.
"This is believed to minimize the reaction to minor and temporary changes in the trend, thus indicating fewer false signals."
A simulated buy order is added when the RSI crosses above the oversold level in strong uptrend conditions.
Rules for simulated sell signals are vice versa: these are added in strong downtrend upon the RSI falling below the overbought level.
Trend existence and strength are analyzed here using the ZigZagTrendPercent indicator.
## Input Parameters ` price ` | The price to be used in calculations.
---|--- ` length ` | The period used in calculation of RSI.
` over bought ` | The overbought level.
` over sold ` | The oversold level.

Referencing Other Data In this chapter we are going to discuss how to reference data which is not defined by current chart settings.
We actually started doing this in chapter 11 where we used secondary aggregation period which overrides timeframe specified in chart settings.
Let's start with referencing fundamental data with a different price type.
"We hope that you've carefully read our reference dealing with fundamental functions , e.g., ` high ` , ` low ` , ` close ` , etc."
In those articles you might have seen that the last argument for each fundamental function is ` priceType ` .
"This argument specifies which value of the fundamental function is needed: LAST, ASK, BID, or MARK."
"By default, this price type coincides with the one specified by chart settings."
"Here is how we could change that: plot ask = close(priceType = ""ASK""); plot bid = close(priceType = ""BID""); On the ""MARK"" price type chart for a Forex symbol, this code will plot ask and bid plots."
"Just like it was explained in chapter 9 , we only change the default value of argument ` priceType ` while keeping the other two ( ` symbol ` and ` period ` ) so that we put the 'equals' sign and state that we need ASK and BID price types for the first and second Close price plots, respectively."
"Note also that for non-Forex symbols, the last three are only supported on intraday charts with time interval not greater than 15 days."
"As it was implied before, you can also change the symbol for some fundamental function in your script: plot spread = close - close(""GOOG""); This will plot the difference between the Close price of your current symbol and that of Google."
"Note how we did not use the full notation for the reference ( ` symbol = ""GOOG"" ` ) as we did for ` priceType ` ."
"This is because ` symbol ` is the first argument for ` close ` (and any other fundamental functions) so that thinkScript automatically decides to use the string ""GOOG"" as the value for it."
The last thing we are going to discuss here is referencing pre-defined studies.
This is a convenient way to use values of more than 200 built-in studies in your script without reconstructing them.
"In order to use default values of the study, type command ` reference ` : plot MyMACD = reference MACDHistogram; This script will add the plot of MACD Histogram which means that you are able incorporate this plot in your own study, e.g., plot MyMACD = reference MACDHistogram; plot diff = Average(close, 5) Average(close, 20); Now your script displays MACD Histogram plot and difference between two averages."
"You can also reference a study with parameters different from default ones: plot SMA = SimpleMovingAvg(volume, 20); This code will plot the 20 period SMA of volume."
"Note that in this case, you need to specify all the parameters that the study has; these should be separated with comma."
"Currently users are only able to reference the built-in studies, however, there is a workaround for integrating their own scripts into new ones."
"This can be done using command ` script ` : script avg { input length = 10; plot SMA = Average(close, length); plot EMA = ExpAverage(close, length); } declare lower; plot SMAOsc = avg(10) - avg(20); plot EMAOsc = avg(10).EMA - avg(20).EMA; The script will plot two moving average oscillators on the lower subgraph."
"Here is what we did: we had the ` script ` command introduce a study called ` avg ` which has two plots, ` SMA ` and ` EMA ` which happen to be simple and exponential moving averages of the Close price with variable length (we had the ` length ` input for this purpose)."
"After that, we declared that we needed the lower subgraph and created two plots: ` SMAOsc ` and ` EMAOsc ` ."
"For the latter, we called the newly created study ` avg ` , specified 10 and 20 in brackets in order to use these as lengths for ` EMA ` plot which was also specified after the dot in the notation: plot EMAOsc = avg(10).EMA - avg(20).EMA; For the SMAOsc plot, we did not state that we needed ` SMA ` from ` avg ` as it was the first plot in that study, thus it is referenced by default and there is no need to specifically call it like we did for ` EMA ` ."
In the next chapter we will learn more about string concatenation as sometimes output demands compound string values.

This study calculates Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in order to reveal correlation between actual price changes and extremely strong trend.
The Spearman indicator registers two sets of data: prices of each bar during the specified period in their chronological order and the same prices sorted ascendingly.
"Spearman's ratio found for these two sets is then multiplied by 100; value of +100 suggests strong correlation with uptrend and -100, with downtrend."
"Since the extreme values of -100 and +100 are rarely recorded, values of +80 and -80 might be used as overbought and oversold levels respectively."
"Plotting the Spearman indicator along with its short SMA (e.g., three day SMA on daily charts) might give an idea when to expect the turning points: look for the crossovers of the two plots."
Useful information can also be obtained by analyzing action of the indicator in relation to zero level: crossing above the zero level might be an opportunity for the Long Entry while falling below zero might suggest the Short Exit.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to be used in calculation of Spearman's ratio.
` length ` | The number of bars in the period on which the prices are registered.
` average length ` | Defines period of SMA of Spearman indicator.
` over bought ` | Defines value of the overbought level.

"This technical indicator is based on the observation that certain patterns often form at high and low swing points, thus signifying that previous trend is about to reverse."
High and low swing points are defined using the ZigZagHighLow technical indicator.
The UpStep pattern can signify reversal of downtrend and is identified upon any of the following conditions: Low swing point candle is bullish and opens within the body of the previous candle (lower of the Open and Close included) and closes above it.
Low swing point candle of either color is followed by a bullish candle which opens within previous candle's body (lower of the Open and Close included) and closes above it.
The DownStep pattern can signify reversal of uptrend and is identified upon any of the following conditions: High swing point candle is bearish and opens within the body of the previous candle (higher of the Open and Close included) and closes below it.
High swing point candle of either color is followed by a bearish candle which opens within previous candle's body (higher of the Open and Close included) and closes below it.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price h ` | The price used in high swing point determination.
` price l ` | The price used in low swing point determination.
` percentage reversal ` | The threshold percentage of price between swing points to connect.
` absolute reversal ` | The absolute value to add to the price change (consisting of percentage change and ATR change components) in order to increase the distance between the swing points.
` atr length ` | Defines period for ATR calculation.
` atr reversal ` | Defines factor by which the ATR value is multiplied.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` UpStep ` | The bullish ZigZag candlestick pattern.

"Values of this indicator are interpreted by the strategy as follows: VHF values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` crit level ` in the input parameters) and its own lowest value times a multiplier are read as indication of trend development; VHF values being greater than a higher threshold level ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters ) but lower than the maximum level are interpreted as strong trending conditions; If either of these conditions is true and close price rises above its own moving average, a simulated buy-to-open order is added."
"In the same conditions, a simulated sell-to-open order is added should the close price fall below the average."
"Simulated exit orders are added based on crossovers of the close price plot with its moving average: when the close price crosses below the average, a simulated sell-to-close order is added; when it crosses above - the simulation of buy-to-close takes place."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF).
---|--- ` lag ` | Defines the period upon which the lowest VHF value is to be found (used in checking for trend development).

"Calculated as the difference between two price averages, this indicator also provides a signal line, an average of that difference."
Crossovers of the MACD plot and the signal line often produce valuable signals for trend analysis.
"When the MACD plot crosses above the signal line, an uptrend may be emerging; conversely, when it falls below, a downtrend is likely to be identified."
"The difference between the MACD and signal values is plotted as a histogram, which may sometimes give you an early sign that a crossover is about to happen."
Actual indication of the crossovers can be enabled by setting the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value to ` yes ` .

HIGH CLOSE ## Technical Analysis # Ascending Triangle The Ascending Triangle is defined by two lines: a horizontal resistance line running through peaks and an uptrend line drawn through the bottoms.
"While two bottoms belonging to the same trendline would suffice for pattern recognition, it is more favorable when there are more."
"This describes perfect conditions for the Ascending Triangle formation, which means that overall signal strength is set to maximum."
"However, it's a rare occasion to find a perfect triangle, so in the majority of cases both trendline and resistance line will be pierced by false intrabar breakouts; the resistance line can be also slightly inclined."
"It is suggested to watch out for false breakouts carefully as they might be easily confused with the true ones when, in fact, the price is going to retreat back into the triangle."
"Generally speaking, the Ascending Triangle is a bullish continuation pattern."
"However, exceptions are quite possible: it's not infrequent to see it develop in downtrend conditions."
"If formed in the downtrend, the Ascending Triangle is more likely to act as a reversal pattern."
Breakouts can also happen in both directions.
"Statistically, upward breakouts are more likely to occur, but downward ones seem to be more reliable."
Majority of breakouts of either direction are observed in the second half of the pattern formation distance.
"In the geometrical sense, this distance is measured between two points: the first high to low reversal and the point at which the trendline and the resistance line cross (so-called apex)."
Volume behavior throughout the pattern formation can be quite erratic and thus risky to rely on.

What was unprecedented about the pandemic plunge was the reason behind it.
Theres no way to predict the entire impact of a pandemic on a global economy.
COVID-19 hit us hard.
"With just about every nation in lockdown, and most people hunkered down at home, the concept of business as usual has changed indefinitely."
This has taken a toll on everyone as well as on the stock markets.
Should we have seen it coming?
Well leave that up to pundits.
"News of the coronavirus surfaced in January, but it wasnt until it started spreading to Europe that the U.S. stock markets reacted."
"By the time the capital markets woke up to the reality of impending pandemic in late February, the black swan event was already under wayand most were unprepared."
"You may not be able to predict when black swans will hit, but you can still be ready for them."
"What tests your mettle as a trader is how quickly you can pivot and respond to new market conditions when they, too, change quickly."
Turn to Black Swan Boot Camp on page 20 to start your training.
"Trading psychology guru and author Mark Douglas put it best when he said, The best traders stay in the flow because they dont try to get anything from the market; they simply make themselves available so they can take advantage of whatever the market is offering at any given moment."
Today is the moment to respond.
Yesterday was about the pandemic.
Tomorrow might be about the elections in November.
Predicting which direction things will go isnt the point.
"As traders, it doesnt matter what is moving a market or where its going."
Make yourself available to its potential opportunities.
"Easier said than done, I know."
Perhaps we can help you get there.

Note that this strategy can only be used to initiate a position and not to extend an existing one.
"It can be accompanied with ThreeBarInsideBarLE for long entries (with ProfitTargetLX and StopLossLX for long exits), ProfitTargetSX and StopLossSX for short exits."

"As it is discussed in his article ADX Breakouts, this strategy is to be applied to stock symbols that satisfy certain price range criteria; to find these symbols, use the ADXBreakoutsFilter study ."
"Based on Average Directional Index (ADX) , the strategy helps spot and utilize high-volatility price breakouts."
The main idea of using ADX in this indicator is a popular suggestion that high ADX values signify high levels of volatility.
Values greater than 40 are perceived as a signal for strong breakout price action.
"Thus, the primary triggering condition is ADX crossing the level of 40, with price being at its 15-day highest (a customizable default value)."
"If such an event occurs, the strategy records the high price and adds a simulated long entry order as soon as price exceeds this value by a certain amount."
This amount is set by default to 50 cents.
"Since the strategy is long entry only, you might want to use other strategies for exits, e.g., TrailingStopLX ."
## Input Parameters ` highest length ` | Defines the period upon which the highest price is determined.
---|--- ` adx length ` | Defines the period for ADX calculation.
` adx level ` | Defines the threshold ADX value for the strategy to trigger a signal.

ADXTrend ATRHighSMABreakoutsLE ## Technical Analysis # SwamiConvolution ## Description The Swami Convolution study is a technical indicator designed for Thermo Mode; it is used for detection of turning points.
"Like in all Thermo Mode specific studies, shorter lookback periods reflect recent changes, middle range periods are used for confirmation, and the longest ones signify possibility of continuation."
"In default color scheme, the turnover points are indicated as purple streaks against deep blue background, i.e., at areas where the study has highest values."
Swami Convolution is based on the eponymous digital signal processing technique which is a mathematical operation on two functions; the result of the operation is area overlap between the two functions as one is shifted against the other.
"In Swami Convolution, this technique is performed on two time series: direct and inverse, both considered as time functions."

See also ` GetAggregationPeriod ` function in the Others section.
"FOUR_HOURS TWO_DAYS def agg = AggregationPeriod.DAY; plot data = close(period = agg); ## Technical Analysis # Triple Bottom The Triple Bottom is the inverse of Triple Top : it is observed as three troughs of similar shape nearly at the same price level, hence the name."
"While the perfect looking Triple Bottom would have a support line containing all the three troughs, variations are possible."
"In fact, patterns where the last bottom is higher than the middle one statistically provide better results."
"Triple Bottom is commonly regarded as a bullish reversal pattern: it might appear in downtrend or after a flat base, providing equally decent results."
"It can also appear after an uptrend, but in this case serious decisions are best avoided: the post-breakout activity after an uptrend is erratic and unpredictable."
Substantial price rises might be expected in Triple Bottoms where the peak between first two troughs is higher than that between the second two.
"Volume tends to be falling throughout the pattern formation, however, as opposed to Triple Tops, volume at breakout does not quite affect the results."
Triangle Triple Top ## Technical Analysis # TrendQuality ## Description The Trend Quality study is another representation of Trend-Noise Balance technical indicator.
It plots a histogram showing the ratio of trend to noise calculated with Trend-Noise Balance on trend sections suggested by Trend Periods study.
"High positive values suggest strong uptrend, low negative values signify strong downtrend, and values fluctuating around the zero level indicate that trend and noise are in equilibrium, i.e., non-trending conditions might be present."

"The sequence consists of three segments, which need to satisfy the following criteria (all specified numbers are used by default and may be customized in the input parameters): The first segment is an uptrend that lasts for at least 20 bars and, during this period, the price has risen by at least 5 dollars."
"The second segment is almost precisely 50% retracement; the precision can be controlled by the ` tolerance ` input parameter, which is set by default to 1%."
The price then rises by at least 0.5 dollars.
The maximum length of the entire sequence is 400 bars.
## Input Parameters ` min length ` | Defines the minimum length of the first segment.
---|--- ` max length ` | Defines the maximum length of the entire pattern.
` min range for uptrend ` | Defines the minimum high-low range of the first segment.
` min up move ` | Defines the minimum up move in the third segment after which the simulated order is added.
` tolerance ` | Defines the maximum possible deviation from the 50% retracement value for the second segment.

Preparation Steps General Settings ## Technical Analysis # CamarillaPoints ## Description The Camarilla Points study is a support-resistance technical indicator designed by Slawomir Bobrowski for range trading.
This indicator is described in his article for March 2013 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities.
"Its main principle is close to that of Pivot Points , however, there are noticeable differences."
"Ten levels are calculated by Camarilla Points: four define support zones, other four define resistance, and two are used for breakout handling."
"These levels are calculated using the High-Low range and Close price on the time frame under consideration with specific coefficient (for full description of mathematics behind this indicator, refer to the article)."
"When market opens within the S3-R3 (third support and resistance levels, see the table of plots) range, price rising to R3 level might be an opportunity for a short position as the market might reverse; level R4 can serve as a stop-loss in this case."
"If price falls down to S3, it might also be profitable to go against the current trend as there is possibility of price growth; level S4 might be used as an initial stop-loss."
"When market opens outside the S3-R3 range, trading with the current trend might be a good idea after price breaks back into it: chances are it reaches the opposite pivot level."
Trend reversals from S3 and R3 might happen several times during the session.
Levels R2 and S2 serve as warning levels: opening a long position at R2 or short position at S2 might result in loss.
"Note that the levels are calculated using data starting from the first visible bar, so study values might vary on different time periods."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` aggregation period ` | Defines aggregation period for Camarilla Points time frame.
` length ` | Defines duration for Camarilla Points time frame.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` R5 ` | The upper breakout handling level.
"` R4 ` | The fourth resistance level, suggested stop-loss value."
"` R3 ` | The third resistance level, possible pivot point."
"` R2 ` | The second resistance level, warning signal."
` R1 ` | The first resistance level.
` S1 ` | The first support level.
"` S2 ` | The second support level, warning signal."
"` S3 ` | The third support level, possible pivot point."
"` S4 ` | The fourth support level, suggested stop-loss value."
` S5 ` | The lower breakout handling level.

thinkManual Mobile Trading Account Summary Discover a quick guide to your account status though an at-a-glance summary on the thinkorswim platform.
FX Currency Map Chat Rooms and Live Support ## How to thinkorswim # Condition Wizard Condition Wizard is a special feature which allows you to build up conditions or logical expressions without the usage of thinkScript.
"Being an alternative to the thinkScript Editor , it does not require special knowledge of thinkScript, which might be especially convenient for new users of Study Alerts , Custom Quotes or Study Filters ."
"In order to switch to Condition Wizard mode of defining conditions (while adding a new study, a custom quote, a study alert, or a study filter in the Stock Hacker scanning tool), make sure that the thinkScript Editor is launched, and click the Condition Wizard tab."
Now you are ready to specify your conditions.
Click the Add condition button; this will launch the Edit Condition dialog.
This dialog will allow you to specify a condition: the relationship between two expressions with some logical check.
"Start with specifying the first expression: in the drop-down list, choose whether it should be a function, a study, a price, or a value."
"While the first two choices speak for themselves, the choice of price will also allow you to use any of the Fundamental functions including the volume, implied volatility, etc."
"; choosing ""Value"" will prompt you to enter a number."
"After that you will need to specify which study, function, or price will be used as the first expression."
"After specifying one, you will see it added with default parameters which can be customized manually; price functions will also allow you to specify a custom aggregation period for which they will be returned (it cannot be less than the current one)."
Note that some functions do not have default parameters; this means you need to specify them.
"These ""obligatory"" parameters are marked with warning signs."
"Note also that for studies that have multiple plots, you will need to specify a single plot whose values will be analyzed (by default, it is going to be the first plot on the list)."
"After specifying the first expression, move to the second column which allows you to specify the relation between the expressions that needs to be checked."
"The commands in this column use human-readable syntax, however, if you are not sure that you understand them fully, please refer to our tutorial ."
"After that, move on to the third column to specify the second expression."
"It can be done in the same way as for the first expression, although note that there is not much sense in comparing two expressions of type ""Value"" as the result will be either always true or always false (two will never equal three, for example)."
Now let's see how it works: we are going to check when a 5 period simple moving average (SMA) crosses a 20 period one.
"In the Edit Condition dialog, we choose ""Study"" and select SimpleMovingAvg from the list."
"We are going to keep the default values for price and displace parameters, only changing value of parameter length to 5."
"In the second column, we select ""crosses above""."
"In the third column, we are going to do the same as in the first one, changing study's length parameter to 20."
This will define the mentioned condition.
"In the dialog window, there are also two extra options."
"First one is offset, it is available in the first and the third columns for studies, price, and certain functions."
Specifying an offset will have the system calculate study or function value several bars prior to or ahead of the current one.
"Positive numbers define bars prior to the current one, while negative numbers signify the forward offset."
"The second extra feature can be described as ""condition expansion""; it is available in the third column and is used to check whether some condition was true at least once for any of the last several bars."
"If, for example, you specify 3 as the value for this parameter, the condition will be perceived as true if it was true for at least one bar out of the last three."
"In thinkScript terms, this parameter replaces the within command."
"Once you have finished composing the condition, click Save ."
The condition will be added to the Conditions list.
"Both Condition Wizard and thinkScript Editor support complex conditions, i.e., those made up of the simple ones connected via logical operators AND and OR."
In the thinkScript Editor these complex formulas are created using reserved words or and and as the connectors.
"In the Condition Wizard, you will need to specify all parts of the complex condition by clicking the Add condition button and choose whether to check it when all or any of the small conditions are true (use the all/any drop-down list for that)."
This means that you can only use the same operator with all condition parts.
"If you need a more complex logic scheme which combines conditional expressions connected with both OR and AND operator, it is suggested that you switch to the thinkScript Editor and manually change the connectors so that they perfectly describe the desirable logic scheme."
"Note that in this case, you will not be able to switch back to the Condition Wizard (unless all condition parts are connected only with either ORs or ANDs), thus, make sure your thinkScript skills are sufficient."
"After finishing with all the necessary condition parts, click OK."
"This will add the condition to where it belongs: a study, a custom quote, a study filter, or a study alert."

"Unlike the regular Momentum study, which analyzes the difference between the current and a past price value, this indicator takes into account the current and a past value of a moving average."
The Momentum Percent Diff calculates the percent ratio of the current simple moving average value to its past value.
This ratio is then smoothed by another simple moving average; the difference between the original ratio and its moving average produces the main histogram plot.
Histogram crossovers above and below the zero level may indicate important trading signals.
## Input Parameters | ---|--- ` price ` | The type of price with which the moving average is calculated.
` price average length ` | The length of the price moving average.
` momentum length ` | Defines the offset for finding the past value of the moving average.
` momentum average length ` | The length of the moving average applied to the ratio.
` show breakout signals ` | Controls indication of histogram crossovers with the zero level.
## Plots | ---|--- ` MomentumHistogram ` | The Momentum Percent Diff histogram.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.
"` UpSignal ` | If enabled, displays an up arrow every time the histogram crosses above the zero level."
"` DownSignal ` | If enabled, displays a down arrow every time the histogram crosses below the zero level."

Uptrend and non-trending market conditions are considered in this strategy.
"To check for trend existence, PriceZoneOscillator strategies use the Average Directional Index (ADX)."
"If the ADX indicates trending conditions, an exponential moving average (EMA) is used for defining trend direction."
"By default, the strategy employs the 14 period ADX and the 60 period EMA."
"In case the uptrend mode is spotted (ADX > 18, price above the EMA), Long Entry signals are issued when: the PZO plot crosses the ""-40"" level from below, or it surpasses the ""+15"" level after crossing the zero line from below."
"In non-trending conditions (ADX < 18), these signals are issued when the PZO plot crosses either the ""-40"" or ""+15"" level from below."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the PZO and EMA are calculated.
` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the PZO and the ADX.
` ema length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMA.

"## Duplicate Confirmation SRO regulations require a duplicate confirmation (of a client's confirmations) be sent to an employing broker-dealer, if the client is an employee of another broker dealer."
"Also, this duplicate confirmation may be sent to a client's attorney if the request is put in writing."
## Technical Analysis # BBDivergence ## Description The BBDivergence is a technical indicator developed by Markos Katsanos; it measures divergence between a security and a related market.
"Based on Mr. Katsanoss article Trading the Loonie, this indicators values are used for recognizing trading signals in the related strategy ."
The BBDivergence study estimates the divergence between two instruments using the following algorithm: 1.
The relative position within the Bollinger Bands is calculated for both primary and secondary symbols.
2.
The divergence is calculated as the percentage difference between these two positions.
3.
"The divergence is then analyzed in relation to two predefined levels, usually placed above and below the zero line."
"As the author suggests, trading signals might be derived based on the behavior of the divergence plot; these signals are used in the BBDivergence strategy after confirmation by other technical indicators."
A buy signal is suggested when the divergence rises above the upper level (set by default at 20%) and then starts declining.
"Vice versa, it might be interpreted as a sell signal when having fallen below the bottom level (-20% by default), the divergence reverses its direction."
## Input Parameters ` secondary symbol ` | Defines the secondary security for divergence calculation.
---|--- ` length ` | The length used in Bollinger Bands calculation.
## Plots ` Divergence ` | The BBDivergence study plot.
---|--- ` UpperLevel ` | The top reference level.

The main principle of using the Fibonacci spiral in technical analysis is setting the first radius as the distance between two significant extremum points of chart.
"If this distance is chosen properly, intersections of the spiral and the price plot are said to mark important price and time targets."
"In order to add the Fibonacci spiral to chart, choose it from the Active Tool menu."
"Specify begin and end points of the trendline (this is going to set the first radius, so consider using significant peak and trough for these purpose); the spiral will develop automatically."

"Human-Readable Syntax While watching price action and indicators reach certain values and conform to certain conditions can provide valuable results, it is often more interesting to know when exactly values reached a notable threshold or trend began its development."
"A popular technique called double crossover method uses two moving averages with different lengths based on a premise that a Buy signal is produced when the shorter moving average crosses above the longer, Sell signal in the opposite situation."
Many chartists use length of 5 for the short SMA and 20 for the long one.
"You are already able to compose a script checking whether the short SMA is above or below the long one: declare lower; plot isAbove = Average(close, 5) > Average (close, 20); Just like you expect, this will plot a line on the lower subgraph with value of 1 when the shorter is above and 0 otherwise."
"But this is not quite what the double crossover method implies: we need to know when exactly the shorter average crossed the longer one from below, i.e., it had been below for some time but started rising and finally went above."
"Human-readable syntax is here to help you: declare lower; plot isAbove = Average(close, 5) crosses above Average (close, 20); In this script, we used two reserved words: crosses and above."
These are two human-readable commands which tell thinkScript to check whether shorter average crossed above the long one.
"Just like it can be expected, the script producing Sell signals for the double crossover method will look like this: declare lower; plot isBelow = Average(close, 5) crosses below Average (close, 20); ""Above"" and ""below"" are additional statements to the main command ""crosses"" they define the direction of crossovers we are interested in."
"If it doesn't matter to us if a line crosses another line from above or below and we only need to know the fact of the crossover itself, either of the two additional commands could be omitted: declare lower; plot Crossover = Average(close, 5) crosses Average (close, 20); Now the lower subgraph will display a line with value of 1 for timestamps where crossovers happen and zero otherwise."
"Moving just a little bit forward: this kind of representation might seem not very convenient and, although output formatting will be discussed in chapters 9 and 10 , consider using the following script to display the crossovers as dots at the bars where they take place: plot Crossover = Average(close, 5) crosses Average (close, 20); Crossover.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); Human-readable syntax is not restricted to crossover identification."
Full vocabulary of commands can be found here .
"A number of sentences can be constructed using this vocabulary in order to define logical expressions, e.g., def condition1 = open is equal to close; def condition2 = close is greater than Average(close,9); def condition3 = condition1 is false and condition2 is false; This looks more like a text than a script, doesn't it?"
"However, it will work: condition1 will check if bars have equal Open and Close price, condition2 will define bars whose Close price is greater than its 9 period SMA, and condition3 will identify bars for which neither of the two is true."
Human-readable syntax can also be helpful to beginners when they need to use a past value of data (this is what we call 'referencing historical data' which is going to be fully described in chapter 11 ).
"For example, if you need to identify bars whose Close price is greater than its previous value, use this script: declare lower; plot Raise = close is greater than close from 1 bar ago; Here, we used expression ""from 1 bar ago"" (which could be easily transformed to ""from 2 bars ago"", ""from 20 bars ago"", ""from 77 bars ago"" whichever you prefer), and the result will be displayed as the line with values of 1 and 0."
"Again, for those who don't like the line representation, the Boolean points can be used: feel free to experiment with the ` SetPaintingStrategy ` function we revealed before."
"Another interesting command is ""within"": it is used to check whether some condition was true at least once for any of the last several bars."
"So, we could expand a bit the previous script: declare lower; plot Raise = close is greater than close from 1 bar ago within 3 bars; Now this script is going to work differently: the line will have value of 1 if the condition is true in at least one of the last three bars."
"Now that we have learned many ways of specifying conditions which will possibly yield some valuable trading signals, we could test them by constructing a strategy to put these signals on chart and estimate the Profit/Loss value."

RSMK calculates the strength of a security relative to another security or index.
It can be used to analyze intermarket relationships.
RSMK is calculated using the following algorithm: 1.
The system calculates the natural logarithm of the ratio of the primary security's close to that of the secondary symbol.
2.
"The same value is calculated for a past bar (by default, 90 bars back)."
3.

## Tender Offer An offer from one company to buy shares of stock of another company from that other company's existing stockholders.
"Those stockholders are asked to ""tender"" (surrender) their shares for a specific price (represented by cash, shares in another company, or both), which is usually higher than the current market price of the stock."
"## Theoretical Value An estimated price of a call or put derived from a mathematical model, such as the Black-Scholes or binomial models."
## Theta An approximation of the decrease in the price of an option over a period of time when all other factors are held constant.
Theta is generally expressed on a daily basis.
"For example, if a call has a price of $3.00 and a theta of 0.10, one day later, with all else unchanged, the call would have a price of $2.90 ($3.00 - (.10 x 1))."
"Generated by a mathematical model, theta depends on the stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rates, dividends, and time to expiration."

# Glossary V A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z ## Vega An approximation of the change in the price of an option relative to a change in the volatility of the underlying stock when all other factors are held constant.
This is typically expressed for a one-percent change in volatility.
"For example, if a call has a price of $2.00 and a vega of .65, if volatility rises 1%, the call would have a price of $2.65 ($2.00 + (.65 x 1.00))."
"Generated by a mathematical model, vega depends on the stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rates, dividends, and time to expiration."
## Vertical Here is a detailed video description.
"An option position composed of either all calls or all puts, with long options and short options at two different strikes."
"The options are all on the same stock and of the same expiration, with the quantity of long options and the quantity of short options netting to zero."
A long call vertical (bull spread) is created by buying a call and selling a call with a higher strike price.
A short call vertical (bear spread) is created by selling a call and buying a call with a higher strike price.
A long put vertical (bear spread) is created by buying a put and selling a put with a lower strike price.
A short put vertical (bull spread) is created by selling a put and buying a put with a lower strike price.
"For example, a short 70/80 put vertical is long 170 put and short 180 put."
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as these can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
"## VIX (Volatility Index) Created by the CBOE, the VIX is an index of volatility calculated from the extrinsic value of out of the money SPX index options."
"## Volatility Generically, volatility is the size of the changes in the price of the underlying security."
"In practice, volatility is presented as either historical or implied."
"## Volatility Skew Volatility skew, or just ""skew"", arises when the implied volatilities of options in one month on one stock are not equal across the different strike prices."
"For example, there is skew in XYZ April options when the 80 strike has an implied volatility of 45%, the 90 strike has an implied volatility of 47%, and the 100 strike has an implied volatility of 50%."
"If the implied volatilities of options in one month on one stock ARE equal across the different strike prices, the skew is said to be ""flat""."
You should be aware of volatility skew because it can dramatically change the risk of your position when the price of the stock begins to move.
## Volume The total number of shares of stock or option contracts traded on a given day.
## Technical Analysis # MovAvgBands ## Description The Moving Average Bands study is a technical indicator developed by Vitali Apirine.
It is calculated as follows: 1.
Two moving averages of the specified type are calculated.
The slower moving average is used as a middle band.
2.
The standard deviation of the faster moving average from the slower one is calculated.
"In the context of this indicator, it is considered the measure of volatility."
3.
"By default, upper and lower bands are plotted one standard deviation above and below the middle band."
The number of standard deviations can be edited in the input parameters.
"Four lines are thus calculated: the upper band, the lower band, the middle band (same as the slower average), and the fast average."
The general trend of the bands can be used for confirmation of the price trend.
The upper and lower bands can be used as dynamic overbought and oversold levels.
The faster moving averages crossovers with the upper and lower bands can help identify entry and exit points.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` fast length ` | The length of the fast moving average.
` slow length ` | The length of the slow moving average.
` multiplier ` | The number of deviations defining the distance between the middle band and the upper and lower bands.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` UpperBand ` | The upper moving average band.

DOLLAR THREE_DECIMAL_PLACES TWO_DECIMAL_PLACES MonkeyVolumeShowStyle OptionClass ## Technical Analysis # PMC ## Description The Persons Market Catcher (PMC) is a variation on Relative Strength Comparative Analysis of one market versus the S&P 500 on a percentage change basis.
The study uses a moving average component to help identify if there is a trend developing in performance over time.
"Its zero line histogram component represents a market's relative strength or weakness in four stages: Outperforming, Weakening, Lagging, and Improving."
"When the histogram bar is above zero and is colored light blue, the market in study may currently be outperforming the S&P 500."
"When the histogram bar is above zero and is colored dark blue, the market in study may have outperformed the S&P 500 but has since entered the weakening stage."
"When the histogram bar is below zero and is colored bright red, the market in study may currently be lagging compared to the S&P 500."
"When the histogram bar is below zero and is colored magenta, the market in study may have been outperformed by the S&P 500 but has since entered the improving stage."
The moving average plot helps identify or confirm that a conditional trend has developed.
The PMC indicator can also be used for indentification of bearish divergence patterns.
"When a market makes a higher high but the indicator fails to do so, the relative performance may actually be weaker than the overall market's, so future highs are likely to be declining."
"Once the PMC histogram falls below zero, the market is likely to be bearish."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Diff ` | The PMC Histogram; the difference between rates of changes in the market in study and that of the S&P 500.
` DiffMA ` | The exponential moving average of the ` Diff ` value.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

Buying and Selling Stock Active Trader ## Technical Analysis # StochasticMACD ## Description The Stochastic MACD indicator is a combination of the stochastic oscillator and the regular Moving Average Convergence/Divergence study.
It was designed by Vitali Apirine in an attempt to measure momentum and define which MACD values correspond to overbought/oversold levels of the traded security.
Here is how Stochastic MACD is calculated: 1\.
"Three moving averages of the specified price are calculated: slow MA, fast MA, and signal MA."
"By default, their lengths are 26, 12, and 9, respectively, and all of the averages are exponential ."
You can change these values and the type of the moving averages using study input parameters.
2\.
"Slow and fast MAs are run through the stochastic oscillator, i.e., the relative positions of both MAs within the high-low range are found."
"By default, the lookup period for the high-low range is set to 45 bars."
"The resulting values are stochastic slow MA and stochastic fast MA, respectively."
3\.
The difference between the stochastic slow and stochastic fast MAs is stochastic MACD.
Positive and growing values of the Stochastic MACD may signify strong upside momentum.
Negative and falling values may be a sign of strong downside momentum.
Use the signal MA line to identify whether the indicator values are increasing or decreasing.
"Stochastic MACD's overbought and oversold levels are set to +10 and -10, respectively."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` stoch length ` | Lookup period for the high-low range.
Used in the calculation of the stochastic moving averages.
` fast length ` | The length of the fast moving average.
` slow length ` | The length of the slow moving average.
` signal length ` | The length of the signal moving average.
` over bought ` | The overbought level.
` over sold ` | The oversold level.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

"If the correlation is found to be higher than a certain threshold (the default value is 0.42), the strategy measures the steepness of the trendline, using Linear Regression Slope ."
"Based on the premise that steeper slopes signify stronger trends (when the absolute value of the slope found is greater than the specified value), the overall trending conditions are evaluated by the strategy as follows: RSquared values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters) and its own prior value while the trendline slope is greater than critical - read as indication of a strong uptrend; RSquared values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters) and its own prior value while the trendline slope is less than the negative critical - read as indication of a strong downtrend."
The first condition triggers a simulated buy-to open order if the close price rises above its own moving average.
"Vice versa, a simulated sell-to-open order is added when the second condition is true should the close price fall below the average."
"Simulated exit orders are added based on crossovers of the close price plot with its moving average: when the close price crosses below the average, a simulated sell-to-close order is added; when it crosses above - the simulation of buy-to-close takes place."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the RSquared.

This might be especially useful when you have many inputs in calculation; so this is a means of quickly getting an idea of their purpose.
Hints need to be placed in study script before the declarations; a special section is added for this purpose.
"To declare hints, use the pound sign (#) and command ` hint ` ."
Here is an example: #hint: <b>Hints</b> \n This study demonstrates hints.
\n <li>And hints for inputs as well.</li> #hint length: <b>Nothing</b> depends on this parameter.
input price = close; input length = 12; plot Data = price; This example script will define two hints: one for the study itself and one for its input ` length ` .
"Note that to add a hint to an input, you need to specify its name after ` #hint ` and add a colon (in the example script above it looks like ` #hint length: ` )."
"For the study hint, you just use the command and prepend a colon ( ` #hint: ` )."
"As you can see, there are also options for text formatting."
Use the ` <b></b> ` tag to conclude the part of text you wish to display in bold.
"To add a line break, use the escape sequence ` \n ` ."
"And, finally, use the ` <li></li> ` tags to break down the description into the list."
Adding hints is also a means of defining default values for Thermo Mode visualization.
"However, in this case, you will need to use the ` thermo ` command instead of ` hint ` ."
"For example: #thermo plot : Data #thermo input : length #thermo minValue : 10 #thermo maxValue : 50 #thermo minColor : 0, 0, 255 #thermo maxColor : 255, 255, 255 input length = 35; plot Data = Average(close, length); When Thermo Mode is enabled, this example script will plot Simple Moving Average of Close price with user-defined parameters, i.e., set the Data plot as the one for Thermo visualization, use the ` length ` parameter as the lookback period, set lower and upper limits for lookback range equal to 10 and 50, respectively, and color lowest values blue, highest values, white."
Consider adding thermo hints to a study with several inputs and plots to explicitly define which input and plot will be used in Thermo Mode.

Using NaN and Infinity Constants to be placed in study script before the declarations; input price = close; input length = 12; plot Data = price; input length = 35; plot Data = Average(close, length); ## Technical Analysis # DMI_Oscillator ## Description The DMI Oscillator is a technical indicator which uses values of DMI in order to predict miscellaneous sides of market behavior."
Two components of DMI are used in calculation: DI+ and DI-; the DMI oscillator calculates the difference between these components and represents it as both a line and a histogram.
"According to the rules described by Barbara Star in her article ""The DMI Stochastic"", the following market conditions can be predicted: When the oscillator is positive and decreasing, a consolidation or pullback might take place."
"When price is in uptrend and the oscillator is positive but makes lower highs, a bearish divergence might be identified."
"Conversely, when price is in downtrend and the oscillator is negative but keeps moving up, a bullish divergence might take place."
Trend continuation might be identified when the oscillator moves to the zero line and then rebounds from it.
"In quiet markets, oscillator values fluctuating near the zero line (approx."
-10 to +10 range) might signify sideways or rangebound price action.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars with which the DI+ and DI- components are calculated.
"` paint bars ` | Defines whether or not to color price plot according to respective oscillator values (red for negative, green for positive)."
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Osc ` | The DMI Oscillator line plot.
` Hist ` | The DMI Oscillator histogram plot.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

"Like all other gadgets, Times and Sales can be displayed as a section of the left sidebar or a separate window (see the Left Sidebar article for details)."
"In the gadget header you will see the following elements: the symbol selector, the ' _clip' icon _ , the full name of the symbol, the current market price of the selected symbol, and its percentage and absolute change since midnight."
The clip icon brings up a color-and-number selection menu; choosing a color in this menu will link Times and Sales to all thinkorswim components with similar color.
Consider linking Times and Sales to a watch list so that clicking through the latter will immediately display the corresponding symbols in Times and Sales.
"Once you have selected the symbol, the working area of the gadget will display the transaction records sorted by transaction time, newest first."
"By default, the gadget will also display the price and the volume of each recorded transaction."
The list of records is refreshed every five minutes and transactions older than that are removed.
"Viewing all recorded transactions might be unnecessary sometimes, so you can filter the records by size of the transaction."

The Buy Formation pattern occurs when there is a sequence of bars each having the Close price less than that four bars ago.
The Sell Formation pattern occurs when there is a sequence of bars each having the Close price greater than that four bars ago.
"Once a Formation pattern is recognized, the bars are given numbers from 1 to 9 by default (the number of bars can be defined according to your preferences by the ` formation period ` input)."
"After the Formation pattern has occurred, the study starts seeking an Array pattern."
The latter might occur after an Intersection condition is fulfilled.
"For a Buy Formation pattern, that condition is existence of a bar having the High price greater than or equal to the Low three or more bars ago (but not earlier than the beginning of the Formation pattern)."
"Conversely, for a Sell Formation pattern, that condition is existence of a bar having the Low price less than or equal to the High three or more bars ago (but not earlier than the beginning of the Formation pattern)."
"Once the Intersection condition is fulfilled, it is a signal for seeking an Array pattern."
"The Array phase begins with the last bar of the Formation (or with the Intersection bar, whichever is later)."
The Array Buy pattern involves a number of bars (not necessarily successive) each having the Close price not greater than the Low two bars ago.
The Array Sell pattern involves a number of bars (not necessarily successive) each having the Close price not less than the High two bars ago.
"Once the Array pattern is recognized, the bars are given numbers from 1 to 13 by default (the number of bars can be defined according to your preferences by the ` array period ` input parameter)."
Note that the Formation/Array sequence is canceled in case of occurrence and completion of the opposing Formation.
"Along with that, a new Formation in the same direction is ignored by the study and is not plotted on the chart."
"After having found a Formation pattern or a Formation/Array sequence, the study indicates Buy and Sell signals."
Those are shown if the sequences meet the so-called Perfection Criteria listed in the following table.
## Perfection Criteria ` Formation Buy Perfection Criteria ` | ` Low < Low[2 bars ago] and Low < Low[3 bars ago] or Low[1 bar ago] < Low[2 bars ago] and Low[1 bar ago] < Low[3 bars ago] ` ---|--- ` Formation Sell Perfection Criteria ` | ` High > High[2 bars ago] and High > High[3 bars ago] or High[1 bar ago] > High[2 bars ago] and High[1 bar ago] > High[3 bars ago] ` ` Array Buy Perfection Criteria ` | ` Low <= Close[5 bars ago] ` ` Array Sell Perfection Criteria ` | ` High >= Close[5 bars ago] ` ## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` array period ` | The number of bars in the Array pattern.

## Today's Option Statistics The Today Options Statistic s section displays the detailed options data.
"To view the data, click on the V-shaped icon before the section title."
You can find the following kinds of data in Today Options Statistics : 1\.
The first section to the left displays a breakdown of the chosen securitys volatility measurements.
There are two data points: IV (Implied Volatility) is a measure of market sentiment regarding the securitys potential movement.
"In general, the higher the implied volatility, the higher the options premium."
HV (historical volatility ) attempts to measure a securitys potential price movement based upon the ranges of price movement a security has historically shown.
The first section displays the 52-week high and low of both of these volatility measurements as well as the percentile of volatility relative to that range.
"The final value in this section is the VWAP, which stands for Volume Weighted Average Price."
VWAP is a measure of the underlyings price based on the number of shares or contracts traded at different prices.
2\.
The area in the center is Trade Analysis .
This collates the records of all options trades recorded for the current date and breaks them down into useful classifications.
"The three different colored columns represent sums of the rows for Calls, Puts, and the aggregated total."
The following rows are shown: Total volume : The aggregate volume of each of these three columns for the current trading day.
Traded at BID or below : The total number of contracts traded at or below the bid price at the time of their execution.
"% of Total : The percentage of Traded at BID or below relative to the total number of calls, puts, or all options traded."
Traded at ASK or above : The total number of contracts traded at or above the ask price at the time of their execution.
"% of Total : The percentage of Traded at ASK or above relative to the total number of calls, puts, or all options traded."
Between the Market : The total number of contracts traded at a price between the quoted bid and ask at the time of execution.
"%of total : The percentage of contracts traded between the market relative to the total number of calls, puts, or all options traded."
Delta between : Collective deltas of all options at the time they were traded divided into quintiles.
"To simplify the display, the deltas of both calls and puts are shown as their absolute value for convenience if you are comparing the delta values in the puts column to the puts section of the option chain."
Note : A negative delta on the chain is equivalent to the positive value on the options statistics page.
3\.
The final section on the far right contains data based on Sizzle Index .
Sizzle Index is a ratio of the current days volume for all options on the underlying against the average of those options previous five days volume.
"In addition to the Sizzle Index, the following values are displayed in this section: Call and Put Sizzle Indice s : These indices measure solely the volumes of that underlyings calls and puts."
Volatility sizzle : This index measures the underlyings current Volatility Index against the average of the past five days.
Stock Sizzle : This index measures the underlyings trading volume against the average of the past five days.
Put-Call ratio : The ratio of the underlyings put volume to its call volume.
## Getting Started The working area of the thinkorswim platform can be divided into two parts: the left sidebar and the main window.
The left sidebar is where you keep gadgets necessary for your work.

2021 TD Ameritrade._ Trading on Android ## Technical Analysis # VolatilityBand ## Description The Volatility Band strategy generates trading signals determined by volatility-based boundaries.
"Like in several other volatility band indicators, these boundaries are placed a number of deviations above and below a mean price value; for Volatility Band, this value is equal by default to simple moving average (SMA) of exponentially smoothed typical price (hlc3) ."
"Deviations are based on the difference between typical and Low price of adjacent bars, taking into account whether the typical price is greater or less than its previous value (for more detailed information on mathematics involved, refer to Sylvain Vervoort's article ""Within the Volatility Band"" published in August 2013 issue of ""Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities"")."
"According to S. Vervoort's observations, prices tend to reach the upper band more often than the lower one; this issue is addressed by using an adjustment factor for the lower band, i.e., the multiplier that makes lower band's shift from the middle line not equal to that of the upper band."
Buy signal is generated when Close price gets higher than the upper band; Sell signal when it falls below the lower band.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price with which the middle line is calculated.
` average length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the SMA.
` volatility length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the third ADX for TAC_ADX.
` deviation factor ` | The number of deviations determining the distance between the middle line and the upper band.

The lenghts of those averages can be either in arithmetic or geometric progression relation: the increment/multiplier of the progression is defined by a user input.
Parallel long-term Ribbon lines signal a strong trend.
Both groups of Ribbon lines converging and fluctuating more than usual is a sign of trend weakness.
A change in price direction accompanied by expanding Ribbon lines in both groups is a sign of a trend start.
"During a short-term reversal, the short- term group crossover, diverge and then again converge, while the long-term group remain parallel."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used to calculate the EMA Ribbon Study.
` base length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the first EMA.
` increment or multiplier ` | The increment/multiplier of the progression.

The Evening Doji Star candlestick pattern is recognized if: The first candle is long and bullish and continues the uptrend; The second candle is Doji that gaps up from the first candle; The third candle is bearish and closes below the first candle's midpoint.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the average body height.
"If the body height of a candle exceeds this average, it is considered long."
"If the body height of a candle is less than 5% of this average, it is considered a Doji candle."

"Areas where ` data1 ` is greater than ` data2 ` are assigned ` color1 ` , others are filled with ` color2 ` ."
"By default, the cloud border is invisble: to make it visible, set the ` showBorder ` parameter value to ` yes ` ."
Note that ` AddCloud ` accepts both defined variables and plots as input parameters.
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- data1 | \- | Defines the first value for comparison.
data2 | \- | Defines the second value for comparison.
color1 | Color.YELLOW | Defines color of sections where ` data1 ` is greater than ` data2 ` .
color1 | Color.RED | Defines color of sections where ` data1 ` is less than or equal to ` data2 ` .
` showBorder ` | no | Controls visibility of the cloud border.
"## Example 1 def OpenPrice = open; def ClosePrice = close; AddCloud(OpenPrice, ClosePrice, color.RED, color.GREEN, yes); In this example, the ` AddCloud ` function draws a translucent cloud that highlights the difference between the values of ` OpenPrice ` and ` ClosePrice ` ."
"Green cloud areas correspond to bull candles, while red areas correspond to bear candles."
"Even though the script contains no plots, the values of ` OpenPrice ` and ` ClosePrice ` are displayed as the cloud border."
"## Example 2 plot CurrentPrice = close; plot PastPrice = close[10]; AddCloud(CurrentPrice, PastPrice, Color.VIOLET, Color.PINK); In this example, the ` AddCloud ` draws the translucent ""cloud"" and paints it according to the following rule: if ` CurrentPrice ` > ` PastPrice ` then the cloud is violet; if ` CurrentPrice ` < ` PastPrice ` then the cloud is pink."
Note that the order in which the arguments appear in the ` AddCloud ` function affects the logics.
"For example, if you swap over the ` PastPrice ` and the ` CurrentPrice ` : plot CurrentPrice = close; plot PastPrice = close[10]; AddCloud(PastPrice, CurrentPrice, Color.VIOLET, Color.PINK); the rule will be: if ` PastPrice ` > ` CurrentPrice, ` then the cloud is violet; if Past ` Price ` < ` CurrentPrice, ` then the cloud is pink."
"## Example 3 Although AddCloud requires that both upper and lower boundaries be specified as plots or variables, it is possible to set those as infinity bounds so that certain chart areas are highlighted."
"Consider the following example: def hiLevel = if close >= Average(close) then Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY else Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY; AddCloud(hiLevel, -hiLevel, Color.LIGHT_GREEN, Color.LIGHT_RED); This script will display infinite vertical stripes on chart: green stripes where the close price is greater than or equal to its average, and red ones where it is less."

"Like in all Thermo Mode specific studies, shorter lookback periods reflect recent changes, middle range periods are used for confirmation, and the longest ones signify possibility of continuation."
"In default color scheme, green areas indicate uptrend and red areas indicate downtrend."
The main component of Swami Intraday Fisher algorithm is Fisher transform which is a mathematical function that applies non-linear gain to extreme values; this function is applied to peak swings of price movements.
"Thus, Swami Intraday Fisher amplifies only larger price swings which makes it most suitable for intraday traders."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used in calculations.

SwamiConvolution SwamiIntradayImpulse ## Technical Analysis # StiffnessStrat ## Description The Stiffness strategy is based on the eponymous technical indicator designed by Markos Katsanos.
"The indicator measures the trend strength based on how many times the price has closed above the 100-bar simple moving average during the lookup period, taking into account the volatility threshold."
The strategy performs a check for uptrend by analyzing exponential moving average values.
Uptrend is detected if the moving average value of a market index rises over the last two bars.
A simulated buy-to-open order is added if uptrend is detected and the Stiffness indicator rises above the entry level (90 by default).
A simulated sell-to-close order is added if the Stiffness indicator falls below the exit level (50 by default) or after a specified period finishes (84 bars by default).
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to be used in the calculation of the Stiffness indicator.
` length ` | The period to be analyzed by the Stiffness indicator.
` average length ` | The length of the simple moving average.
` exit length ` | The maximum holding period since the entry.
"` num dev ` | The volatility threshold, measured in standard deviations."
The price is only considered to be above the moving average if it is greater than the average by this value.
` entry stiffness level ` | The level of the Stiffness indicator at which the buy-to-open simulated order is added.
` exit stiffness level ` | The level of the Stiffness indicator at which the sell-to-close simulated order is added.
` market index ` | The market index to check for uptrend.

The strategy uses rating scores provided by the eponymous study to add simulated buy orders.
The score is calculated based on stock performance in terms of meeting five technical analysis criteria.
The following criteria are taken into account when assigning a rating to a stock symbol: Money flow: This criterion is met if the symbol's current Volume Flow Indicator value is positive.
Trading above average: This criterion is met if the close price is greater than its simple moving average (SMA).
In uptrend: This criterion is met if the SMA value has increased over the last four bars.
Trend quality: This criterion is met if the total number of crossovers between the price and its moving average during the lookup period does not exceed a certain value.
Overall market direction: This criterion is met if the exponential moving average of the appropriate market index has increased over the last two bars.
The stock symbol receives one point for meeting each of the above criteria if all the weights are set to 1.0.
"By default, only the ""overall market direction"" weight is equal to 2.0; however, you are free to assign the weights according to your preferences."
"By default, the strategy adds a simulated buy to open order if the currently selected stock receives a rating score of 5.0 or higher."
"A simulated sell to close order is added when a specified number of bars elapses since the entry, which is by default set to 63."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` vfi length ` | Defines the period for which the Volume Flow Index is calculated.
"Used when checking for the ""money flow"" criterion."
` average length ` | Defines the period for which the simple moving average is calculated.
"Used when checking for the ""trading above average"" and ""in uptrend"" criteria."
"` trend quality length ` | Defines the lookup period for checking for the ""trend quality"" criterion."
` exit length ` | Defines how many bars are to elapse since the simulated entry for the simulated sell to close order to be added.
"` max stiffness ` | Defines the maximum number of times the price is allowed to break through the SMA during the ""trend quality"" lookup period."
"` market index ` | Defines the market index to check for the ""overall market direction"" criterion."
` score crit ` | Defines the minimum stock rating score for the simulated buy to open order to be added.
"` weight for money flow ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""money flow"" criterion."
"` weight for trading above average ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""trading above average"" criterion."
"` weight for uptrend ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""in uptrend"" criterion."
"` weight for trend quality ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""trend quality"" criterion."
"` weight for market direction ` | Defines the weight for points scored for meeting the ""overall market direction"" criterion."

"Go ahead; and adjust you axis; ## Technical Analysis # EhlersRoofingFilter ## Description The Ehlers' Roofing Filter is an expansion on Ehlers Super Smoother Filter , both being smoothing techniques developed by John F. Ehlers, based on aerospace analog filters."
"This filter aims at reducing noise in price data, which appears to be stronger as the high-to-low price swings increase especially when chart is plotted for greater time intervals."
"In Super Smoother Filter, regardless of the time frame used, all waves having cycles of less than 10 bars are considered noise (customizable via input parameters)."
"The Roofing Filter uses this principle, however, it also creates a so-called ""roof"" by eliminating wave components with long periods which are perceived as ""spectral dilation"" (by default, at least 48 bars)."
"Thus, the filter only passes those spectral components whose periods are between 10 and 48 bars."
This technique noticeably reduces indicator lag and also helps assess turning points more accurately.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to which the filter is applied.
` cutoff length ` | Defines the minimum cycle length in bars.
Cycles with lesser lengths will be considered noise and eliminated.
` roof cutoff length ` | Defines the maximum cycle length in bars.
Cycles with greater lengths will be considered spectral dilation and eliminated.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` RoofingFilter ` | The Ehlers' Roofing Filter.

As discussed in ... ## Technical Analysis # VolumeFlowIndicator ## Description The Volume Flow Indicator is a long-term trend following study which uses the same principle as On Balance Volume .
"However, instead of comparing two Close prices of adjacent bars, it compares change in typical price with a so-called ""cut off"" value based on standard deviation."
"After that, volume for each bar is taken into account with a sign: positive or negative, based on the mentioned comparison."
"The final result is exponentially smoothed ratio of cumulative sum of ""directed"" volume to average volume over last 50 bars."
Values above the zero level are considered bullish and indicate long-term accumulation.
"Vice versa, negative values indicate distribution, thus being a bearish signal."
The Volume Flow Indicator is also used for spotting divergence; divergence in volume might signify trend reversal.
Trend might be losing momentum when the Volume Flow Indicator fails to confirm a new High or Low in a cycle.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the Volume Flow Indicator.
"` max volume cut off ` | The coefficient used in calculation of volume ""cut off"" value."
Lower values of this coefficient mean stronger damping of volume spikes.

GetSplitNumerator HasEarnings plot ConfCall = HasConferenceCall(); ## Technical Analysis # CAM_Indicator ## Description The CAM_Indicator is a trend-detecting study based on coordinated usage of the Average Directional Index (ADX) and the Moving Average Divergence/Convergence (MACD) oscillator on the same chart.
The CAM prefix stands for Coordinated ADX and MACD.
"The ADX study is used to assess the strength of the current trend, while the MACD oscillator is used to detect the direction of that same trend."
"By default, all of the four boolean study plots are hidden: instead, the price plot is colored based on the conditions represented by each."
"These conditions are listed with the corresponding plot names, default price plot coloring, and possible interpretations below: CAM_UP: When both ADX and MACD are rising, the study recognizes an upside momentum and colors the price plot green."
"CAM_PB: When both ADX and MACD are declining, the study recognizes a possible pullback and colors the price plot yellow."
"CAM_DN: When ADX is rising but MACD is declining, the study recognizes possible downtrend conditions and colors the price plot red."
"CAM_CT: When MACD is rising but ADX is declining, the study recognizes a possible countertrend rally and colors the price plot blue."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` adx length ` | Defines the period over which ADX is to be calculated.
` macd fast length ` | Defines the period over which the fast component of MACD is to be calculated.
` macd slow length ` | Defines the period over which the slow component of MACD is to be calculated.

"When market opens within the S3-R3 range, it is supposed a premise for possible trend reversal, so Long Entry signal is given if market closes below S3; Short Entry signal if it closes above R3."
"Market opening outside the S3-R3 range might signify that trend will keep its direction; in this case, Long Entry signal is indicated when the market closes above S3 and Short Entry signal when it closes below R3."
Exit signals are indicated based upon the stop-loss levels S4 and R4 (in addition to the mentioned S3 and R3).
Long Exit signal is given when either Low price falls below S4 or High price gets above R3.
Short Exit signal is suggested when either High price rises above R4 or Low price is below S3.

"This feature shows ... SlowRSI The Slow Relative Strength Index is a version of the classic Relative Strength Index (RSI), ... ## Technical Analysis # Ermanometry ## Description Ermanometry is a technical indicator which indicates trend turning points based on the premise that price changes in the fixed-ratio manner."
The fixed- ratio is established by calculating the number of bars in the first two trend segments on chart: uptrend and downtrend (or vice versa).
You can specify the desired trend segments by starting date and time of the first segment and the number of bars in each.
"Once the lengths are specified, study calculates time points of the expected trend reversals."
"This can be done by using a linear rectangular spiral, where the found lengths are the seed segments (DE and EF)."
"As was proposed by William Erman, the following segments are calculated: FH, GH, HI, IJ, DE+EF+CD, GH+HI+IJ, CD+DE+EF+FG+GH+HI, EF+FG+GH, CD+DE+EF+FG+GH, GH+IJ+CD+AB+EF."
"Andrew Coles expanded this list by adding the following segments: FH+FG+GH, AB+BC+CD+DE, AB+BC+CD+DE+GH, FG+GH, GH+HI, FG+BC+CD, FG+BC+CD+DE, CD+BC, DE+BC, CD+DE+EC, EF+FG+EG."
"Once calculated, these segments consequently mark the expected turnover points."
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` start date ` | The start date of the first trend segment, specified in YYYYMMDD format."
"` start time ` | The start time of the first trend segment, specified in HHMM format, EST timezone."

"Downtrend and non-trending market conditions are considered in this strategy.To check for trend existence, PriceZoneOscillator strategies use the Average Directional Index (ADX)."
"If the ADX indicates trending conditions, an exponential moving average (EMA) is used for defining trend direction."
"By default, the strategy employs the 14 period ADX and the 60 period EMA."
"In case the downtrend mode is spotted (ADX > 18, price below the EMA), Short Entry signals are issued when: the PZO plot crosses the ""+40"" level from above, or it falls below the ""-5"" level after crossing the zero line from above."
"In non-trending conditions (ADX < 18), these signals are issued when the PZO plot crosses either the ""+40"" or ""-5"" level from above."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the PZO and EMA are calculated.
` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the PZO and the ADX.
` ema length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the EMA.

PMO is essentially one-bar rate of change (relative momentum) consequently smoothed by two exponential moving averages.
"In addition to the main plot, the PMO study also shows a signal line: the PMO line smoothed again by a third exponential moving average."
The main PMO line oscillates around the zero level.
Extremely high readings of the PMO indicator may suggest that the stock or index is currently overbought.
"Vice versa, extremely low readings may signify that the stock or index is oversold."
"In addition, one may find beneficial looking for divergences between the price plot and the PMO line."
These divergences may signify important changes in the trend.
"Lastly, bullish and bearish crossovers of the main line and the signal line may be used as potential buy or sell signals."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price to be used in the calculation of PMO.
` length1 ` | The length of the first exponential moving average to smooth the rate of change with.
` length2 ` | The length of the second exponential moving average to smooth the rate of change with.

MAGENTA PINK Access Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Access Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) | thinkorswim Economic Data Tab Fundamentals Tab in thinkorswim ## Technical Analysis # FM_Demodulator ## Description FM Demodulator is a technical indicator that singles out the frequency modulation component out of market data cycles.
It does so by applying a hard limiter that eliminates all amplitude information from the market data spectrum.
"Based on signal processing techniques, this indicator can help detect potential turning points in market data."
FM Demodulator is calculated as follows: 1.
Hard limiter is applied to the difference between the close and open for each bar during the indicator period: the difference is multiplied by the specified factor and the results are cut off to fit the -1 to +1 range.
2.
The Super Smoother filter is applied to the result.
The resulting indicator can help detect major price swings.
Peaks and valleys of the indicator plot can be used for confirmation of the price action.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` cutoff length ` | The length to calculate the cutoff filter with.
` hard limiter factor ` | The factor to multiply the difference between close and open by.
Used in the calculation of hard limiter.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Timing ` | The FM Demodulator plot.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.

"Formatting Output: Part II Some time ago, plots were mandatory for thinkScript studies."
"If someone tried adding a study without any plots, they saw an error message: ""At least one plot should be declared""."
"Well, now it is not an error message any more: it is just a friendly reminder as, for most of the studies, plots are still expected."
"For most, but not for all: let's see how to replace plots with some of the Look and Feel functions."
Let's start with function ` AddLabel ` .
This function adds a nice little label to the upper left corner of chart.
"This label indicates whichever data you prefer: AddLabel(yes, if close > Average(close, 20) then ""Uptrend"" else ""Downtrend""); This label will display word ""Uptrend"" if Close price is greater than its 20 period SMA and ""Downtrend"" otherwise."
"First argument of this function is a condition upon which the label is displayed; here, we used word ` yes ` for the label to be always visible."
"We also specified a condition ( ` close > Average(close, 20) ` ) which will select either word ""Uptrend"" or ""Downtrend"" to be shown, however, you might want to display some calculated value without any conditions: AddLabel(yes, Average(close, 20)); Now the label will display value of the SMA itself."
"You can also add a short explanation of what is being displayed by using the following notation: AddLabel(yes, ""Average: "" + Average(close, 20)); Here we specified the text to be displayed and concatenated it with the value of the average using the sign ""+""."
"There is also another way to concatenate some values in a string, which is the Concat function, but we advise that you use the plus sign as it is much more convenient."
"And, of course, we could not leave you without an option to choose the color of the label."
"By default, it is displayed red, but let's make it dark orange: AddLabel(yes, Average(close, 20), Color.DARK_ORANGE); We used the simplest way, the Color constant, but you are free to color the label using techniques described in previous chapter ."
"For example, let's make it chartreuse green (RGB value: 127,255,0 ): AddLabel(yes, Average(close, 20),CreateColor(127,255,0)); Now you are displaying this label with a color which is the most visible to human eye."
Feel free to experiment with other colors.
"Also, you can add some dynamic coloring: AddLabel(yes, Average(close, 20), if close > Average(close, 20) then Color.GREEN else Color.RED); This script will display 20 period SMA of Close price in a green label if Close price is greater than this average, or in a red label when the Close price is lower."
"To sum it up, three arguments can be used for ` AddLabel ` function."
"These arguments are: condition upon which the label is visible (state ` yes ` to make it always visible), text and values to be displayed (specify text in quotes and use the ""+"" sign to concatenate it with a value), and color which is red by default."
Another way to output values is showing bubbles at price bars.
"This is done by using ` AddChartBubble ` function: AddChartBubble(close crosses above Average(close, 20), close, ""Close price "" + close + "" is greater""); This script will display chart bubbles at bars where Close price crosses above its 20 period SMA."
"Bubbles will be displayed at Close price of these bars (this is what the second argument, ` close ` , stands for) with default color (red)."
"By default, bubbles are located above the price plot; if you would like to display them below, transform this script into: AddChartBubble(close crosses above Average(close, 20), close, ""Close price "" + close + "" is greater"", up = no); Here, we explicitly set the value of the last argument ` up ` to ` no ` ."
"So far, we customized each function in such a way where all the arguments change their default values."
This is a perfect example of what should be done if you are fine with some of the arguments' default values but would like to change those of others: you specify the name of the argument and assign a value to it with the 'equals' sign.
Name of each argument of each function can be found in thinkScript Reference.
"For ` AddChartBubble ` function, the following arguments can be used: ` time condition ` (condition upon which the bubble is displayed), ` price location ` (price at which the bubble is shown), ` text ` (information to be displayed in the bubble), ` color ` (use a color constant or a color-related function), and ` up ` (defines whether the bubble should be displayed above the price plot)."
"When a bubble is not enough to draw attention to some price action, you can add a vertical line with some text."
"Function ` AddVerticalLine ` is used for this purpose: AddVerticalLine(close crosses above Average(close, 20), ""Close price "" + close + "" is greater""); This script will mark the same bars as the previous did, but the vertical lines will be displayed instead of bubbles."
"Arguments for the ` AddVerticalLine ` function are: ` visible ` (identical to ` time condition ` argument of ` AddChartBubble ` ), ` text ` (has the same application as the two previously described functions), ` color ` (all the same, again), and ` stroke ` (the style of the line to be displayed, set with Curve constants)."
"The last but not the least, ` AddCloud ` function is a nice way to avoid several plots when you only need difference in their values."
"This function visualizes the difference between two calculated values by filling area between them with a translucent color: def avg1 = Average(close, 5); def avg2 = Average(close, 20); AddCloud(avg1, avg2, Color.PINK, Color.BLUE); This script is another visualization of the previously mentioned double crossover method."
We have two SMAs of the Close price: 5 period and 20 period.
"` AddCloud ` function visualizes difference between them in the following way: those sections where the shorter average is greater are colored pink and those where the longer is greater, blue."
Remember not to swap the arguments as this function compares the first argument to the second and colors the mentioned sections in respective colors.
We hope that you had fun using the Look&Feel functions described in this and previous chapters as we are moving on to some advanced material concerning logics of referencing data in thinkScript.

"Formatting Output: Part I yes, if close > Average(close, 20) then ""Uptrend"" else ""Downtrend""); is displayed; yes, Average(close, 20)); yes, ""Average: "" + Average(close, 20)); yes, Average(close, 20), Color.DARK_ORANGE); yes, Average(close, 20),CreateColor(127,255,0)); yes, Average(close, 20), if close > Average(close, 20) then Color.GREEN else Color.RED); crosses above Average(close, 20), close, ""Close price "" + close + "" is greater""); default, bubbles are located above the price plot; crosses above Average(close, 20), close, ""Close price "" + close + "" is greater"", up = no); crosses above Average(close, 20), ""Close price "" + close + "" is greater""); def avg1 = Average(close, 5); def avg2 = Average(close, 20); ## Technical Analysis # DefineColor ` DefineColor ( String name, CustomColor color); ` ## Description Defines a named color for a plot with the default color value."
This color can be changed in the Edit Studies dialog.
## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- name | \- | Defines the name of the color.
color | \- | Defines color to be used with specified name.

The ` DefineColor ` function defines Positive and Negative color names as aliases for ` Color.UPTICK ` and ` Color.DOWNTICK ` constants.
You can change the colors in the Edit Studies dialog and their order is the same as in the source code.
If the trend of the plot is positive then it is painted in Positive (Uptick) color.
"If the trend is negative, the plot is painted in Negative (Downtick) color."
Note that in order to refer to a specific color the code uses the ` Color ` function.

"All Products Buying and Selling Stock ## Technical Analysis # DMI ## Description The Directional Movement Index (DMI) comprises three plots: DI+, DI-, and ADX (Average Directional Index)."
"DI+ is calculated as an average increase of high price (if the high price decreases, 0 is taken), divided by the ATR (Average True Range) and multiplied by 100."
"DI- is calculated similarly, using the decrease of low price instead."
"By default, in the calculation of both DI+ and DI-, the Wilder's average is used, however, you are free to choose other average types in input parameters."
ADX is calculated as an average of the directional index; the average type is the same as in DI+ and DI.
"The directional index, in turn, is equal to the percentage ratio of the absolute value of difference between DI+ and DI- to their sum."
DMI is a trend-following indicator.
"DI+ crossing above the DI- suggests uptrend conditions, and vice versa, DI+ crossing below the DI- might signify the downtrend."
ADX is used for confirmation: trend indications are more likely to be correct if ADX is rising and its values are above 50.
"## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate DI+, DI-, and ADX."
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."

BUY_AUTO BUY_TO_OPEN ## Technical Analysis # ThreeOutsideUp ## Description Three Outside Up is a bullish trend reversal candlestick pattern consisting of three candles.
The first two candles of this candlestick pattern form bullish Engulfing .
The Three Outside Up candlestick pattern is recognized if: The first candle is bearish and continues the downtrend; The second candle is long and bullish and its body engulfs the first candle's body; The third candle is bullish and its Close price is higher than that of the second candle.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the average body height.
"If the body height of a candle exceeds this average, it is considered long."
` trend setup ` | The number of preceding bars to check if the trend exists.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Bullish ` | The Three Outside Up candlestick pattern.
ThreeInsideUp ThreeStarsInTheSouth is bearish and continues the downtrend; is long and bullish and its body engulfs the first candle's body; ## Technical Analysis # StochasticFull ## Description The Stochastic Full study is a generalized version of the Stochastic Fast and the Stochastic Slow oscillators.
"The three oscillators are all based on the observationthat in an uptrending market, prices tend to close near the upper end of the price range."
"In downtrends, close prices are often seen approach the lower end."
The calculation of the Stochastic Full resembles that of the Stochastic Fast and the Stochastic Slow.
"The first value calculated is %K: by default, it is the ratio of the difference between the current close and the lowest low on a period to the difference between the highest and the lowest prices on the same period."
"The first main plot, FullK, is produced by smoothing this value with a moving average of choice."
"The other plot, FullD, is a moving average of FullK over a chosen period."
Both lines oscillate in the range from 0 to 100.
The Stochastic Full oscillator may thus act as both the Stochastic Fast and the Stochastic Slow.
"Setting the slowing period to 1 will eliminate the slowing effect of the first moving average, thus making the formula identical to that of the FastK."
Setting the period to 3 will transform the oscillator into the Stochastic Slow.
You can also use any custom slowing period.
The analysis technique is the same as in other oscillators: the crossovers of main plots with overbought/oversold levels are normally looked for.
Actual indication of the crossovers can be enabled by adjusting the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` over bought ` | The overbought level value.
` over sold ` | The oversold level value.
` k period ` | The period for which the highest and the lowest price values are to be found.
` d period ` | The length of the moving average to be applied to FullK.
This produces the FullD plot.
` price h ` | The type of price whose highest value is to be found on the specified period.
` price l ` | The type of price whose lowest value is to be found on the specified period.
` price c ` | The type of price whose latest value is to be found.
` slowing period ` | The length of the moving average to be applied to %K.
This produces the FullK plot.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
` show breakout signals ` | Controls indication of Stochastic Full crossovers above and below the overbought/oversold levels.
Specify for which of the main plots the crossovers are to be indicated.
"## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` FullK ` | FullK value, 'slowing period' moving average of %K."
"` FullD ` | FullD value, 'd period' moving average of FullK."
` OverBought ` | The overbought level.
` OverSold ` | The oversold level.
"` UpSignal ` | If enabled, displays an up arrow every time the specified main plot crosses above the oversold level."
"` DownSignal ` | If enabled, displays a down arrow every time the specified main plot crosses below the overbought level."

"Placing Option Trades: Calendars Placing Option Trades on Futures ## Technical Analysis # IntradayFlagFormationStrat ## Description The Intraday Flag Formation strategy is an attempt to successfully identify, enter, and exit the well-known Flag pattern on intraday charts."
"This approach was described by Markos Katsanos in his article ""Detecting Flags in Intraday Charts."""
"Although intraday flags have the same geometric principles as daily ones, it is suggested that the former conform to more strict criteria."
These apply mostly to the shape of flag elements (the pole and the flag itself) and their duration.
"You can customize the criteria in the input parameters, however, the current article discusses their default values."
A simulated entry order is added when the flag is identified and all of the following is true: There is currently no open market position; The flag pole height is at least 5.5 times the average true range (ATR) and its formation takes no longer than 23 bars; The flag itself is not wider than 2.5 times the ATR and its formation takes no longer than 15 bars; There is an uptrend before the flag formation and it persists for at least 70 bars; Previous flag formation (if any) occurred at least 50 bars ago; The ATR has changed by at least 5% during the flag formation; A breakout from the formation occurs.
"When there is an open position, the strategy starts seeking exit possibilities."
An exit order is added when any of the following is true: Price reaches the profit target equal to 1.2 times the pole; Price reaches the stop loss or the trailing stop loss (both customizable via input parameters); Inactivity period is longer than 70 bars.
Inactivity means that the minimum favorable advance is less than 4 times the ATR; None of the above happens for 100 bars since the entry point.
## Input Parameters ` max flag length ` | The maximum number of bars since the pole top.
"---|--- ` max flag height ` | The maximum flag width, expressed in ATRs."
"` max pole length ` | The maximum duration of the pole formation, in bars."
"` min pole height ` | The minimum pole length (bottom-to-top), expressed in ATRs."
"` up trend length ` | The minimum duration of the preceding uptrend, in bars."
` min length between flags ` | The minimum number of bars from the previous flag.
` min atr percent change ` | The minimum ATR percent change during the formation.
"` strict breakout ` | If set to yes, the breakout is identified when the price grows out of the flag."
"If no, a bullish bar with close higher than the previous would suffice."
` profit target constant ` | The profit target coefficient.
The profit target is calculated as the pole top value times this coefficient.
` stop loss delay length ` | Defines the length for the stop loss calculation.
` stop atr ` | The number of ATRs that defines the stop loss below the flag.
` trail stop length ` | Defines the length for the trailing stop calculation.
` trail stop atr ` | The number of ATRs that defines the trailing stop.
"` inactivity exit length ` | The maximum inactvity duration, in bars."
` inactivity atr ` | Defines the multiplier in the inactivity identification.
` time exit length ` | Defines the maximum period for the position to be open.

"It is based on the theory that when prices move too far away from the mean, there is a chance of price reversion."
"The strategy adds simulated buy and sell signals based on the following values: price, two simple moving averages, and zScore."
The latter is the ratio of the difference between the price and its average to the standard deviation of the price.
The strategy adds simulated orders based on the following conditions: Buy to open: zScore falls below -1.0 while the faster SMA is above the slower one; Sell to close: zScore rises above -0.5; Sell to open: zScore rises above 1.0 while the faster SMA is below the slower one; Buy to close: zScore falls below 0.5.
"By default, the faster SMA has the length equal to the length with which zScore is calculated."
The slower SMA has the length ten times the length of zScore.
All the mentioned numbers can be customized in the input parameters.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price for which the averages and zScore are to be calculated.
` length ` | The length with which zScore is to be calculated.
` fast length factor ` | The factor by which ` length ` is to be multiplied to obtain the length of the faster moving average.
` slow length factor ` | The factor by which the ` length ` is to be multiplied to obtain the length of the slower moving average.
` z score entry level ` | Defines the critical value of zScore for triggering a simulated sell-to-open order.
"For simulated buy-to-open orders, the opposite number is used."
` z score exit level ` | Defines the critical value of zScore for triggering a simulated buy-to-close order.
"For simulated sell-to-close orders, the opposite number is used."

"IOC orders allow partial fills, with the balance of the order canceled."
## Implied Volatility An estimate of the volatility of the underlying stock that is derived from the market value of an option.
"Implied volatility is the volatility number that, if plugged into a theoretical pricing model along with all the other inputs, would yield a theoretical value of an option equal to the market price of the same option."
Compare to historical volatility.
## Index A proxy for the overall stock market or segments of the stock market.
An index is typically made up of a group of stocks that are selected to represent all stocks in the stock market or market segment (such as technology stocks or large capitalization stocks).
The performance of the index gives an idea of how individual stocks might be performing.
The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) and Dow Jones Industrial Average are two well-known indices.
## Index Option An option that has a stock index as the underlying asset.
The value of an index option is based on the value of the index.
"Typically, index options are cash settled options."
## Initial Margin Requirement The amount of equity a client must deposit when making a new purchase in a margin account.
For retail clients the SEC's Regulation T requirement for equity securities currently stands at 50% of the purchase price.
"In addition, the FINRA and NYSE initial margin requirement is a deposit of $2,000 but not more than 100% of the purchase price."
Purchases of options must be paid for in full while the sale of naked options is subject to house requirements prescribed by TD Ameritrade.
"Also, the amount of money required to be in an account with a brokerage firm to carry a new position into the next trading day."
## Initial Public Offering (IPO) A corporation's first sale of stock to the public.
"## Institutional Investors Organizations such as mutual funds, pension funds, endowment funds, and insurance companies that typically have very large sums of money to invest."
## Interest Money paid when borrowing money or money earned when lending money.
"## Interest Rate A percentage that is charged when borrowing money, or that is earned when lending money."
## Interest Rate Risk Risk that a change in interest rates will cause a position to change in value.
## In-The-Money (ITM) A call option is in-the-money when the price of the underlying stock is greater than the call's strike price.
.
"Conversely, a put option is in-the- money when the price of the underlying stock is lower than the put's strike price."
"At expiration, options that are .01 ITM are automatically exercised."
## Intrinsic Value Any positive value resulting from the stock price minus the strike price (for calls) or strike price minus the stock price (for puts).
"Only in-the-money options have intrinsic value, and intrinsic value can never be zero or less."
"For example, if a call option with a strike price of $50 has a price of $2.75, with the stock price at $52, the intrinsic value is $2.00."
"If a put option with a strike price of $15 has a price of $1.50, with the stock price at $14, the intrinsic value is $1.00."
Compare to extrinsic value.
## Investor Someone who purchases a stock with the intent of holding it for a certain amount of time and profiting from the transaction.
Compare to day trading.
"## Iron Butterfly Spread An option spread composed of calls and puts, with long options and short options at three different strikes."
"The options are all on the same stock and of the same expiration, with the quantity of long options and the quantity of short options netting to zero."
The strikes are equidistant from each other.
An iron butterfly can be seen as a straddle at the middle strike and a strangle at the outer strikes.
"For example, a long 50/60/70 iron butterfly is long 150 put, short 160 call, short 160 put, and long 170 call."
"It's important to understand that you initiate an iron butterfly for a credit, that is, you take money in."
The profit potential is limited to the credit received.
It is a limited risk and limited profit strategy.
"Please note that multiple-leg option strategies such as this can entail substantial transaction costs, including multiple commissions, which may impact any potential return."
"## Iron Condor Spread An option spread composed of calls and puts, with long options and short options at four different strikes."
"The options are all on the same stock and of the same expiration, with the quantity of long options and the quantity of short options netting to zero."
"Generally, the strikes are equidistant from each other, but if the strikes are not equidistant, the spread is called an iron pterodactyl."
An iron condor can be seen as a strangle at the middle strike and a strangle at the outer strikes.
"For example, a long 50/55/60/65 iron condor is long 150 put, short 155 put, short 160 call, and long 165 call."
"It's important to understand that you initiate an iron condor for a credit, that is, you take money in."

Placing Option Trades Forex Trader ## Technical Analysis # lower ## Syntax ` declare lower; ` ## Description Places a study on the lower subgraph.
This declaration is used when your study uses values that are considerably lower or higher than price history or volume values.
"## Example (Price Oscillator) declare lower; input price = close; input fastLength = 9; input slowLength = 18; plot PriceOsc = Average(price, fastLength) - Average(price, slowLength); The example plots the difference between the two average values calculated on 9 and 18-bar intervals."
The result value is lower compared to the ` price ` value.
"Therefore, it is reasonable to put the plot on the lower subgraph to avoid scaling the main chart."

"If an inside bar formed inside two higher closes, then it is considered to be a three-bar inside bar positive reversal."
"The positive Three-Bar Inside Bar pattern is recognized if: The first bar's Close price is lower than that of the second bar; The third bar's High price is less than that of the previous bar; The third bar's Low price is greater than that of the previous bar; The fourth bar's Close price is higher than that of the previous bar; In the event of the positive Three-Bar Inside Bar pattern, this strategy generates the Long Entry signal for the next bar."
Note that this strategy can only be used to initiate a position and not to extend an existing one.
"It can be accompanied with ThreeBarInsideBarSE for short entries (with ProfitTargetSX and StopLossSX for short exits), ProfitTargetLX and StopLossLX for long exits."
"Note that, by default, this strategy can only be used to open a new position but not to close the existing one."

There are two ways to use the function.
"First, you can use it as the right side of an equation with 3 parameters: a condition, a ` true ` value and a ` false ` value."
"Secondly, you can use it in a conjunction with ` else ` to create more complex conditions."
Note that input arguments can only be numerical of type ` double ` .
If other values are needed (e.g.
"Color constants), use the if-expression ."
E.g.
"for CustomColor arguments, the following code is valid: AssignPriceColor(if close > open then Color.UPTICK else Color.DOWNTICK); The following script will result in compilation error as type ` CustomColor ` is not compatible with type ` double ` : AssignPriceColor(if(close > open, Color.UPTICK, Color.DOWNTICK)); ## Input parameters Parameter | Default value | Description ---|---|--- condition | \- | Defines condition to be tested."
true value | \- | Defines value to be returned if condition is true.
false value | \- | Defines value to be returned if condition is false.
"## Example plot Maximum1 = If(close > open, close, open); plot Maximum2 = if close > open then close else open; plot Maximum3; if close > open { Maximum3 = close; } else { Maximum3 = open; } The code draws either ` close ` or ` open ` value depending on the condition in the if-statement."
"If close is higher than ` open ` , then ` close ` is drawn, otherwise ` open ` is drawn."
` Maximum2 ` and ` Maximum3 ` plots use alternative solutions such as if-expression and if-statement correspondingly.
"HasContractChangeEvent TickSize false value); if close > open then Color.UPTICK else Color.DOWNTICK); if(close > open, Color.UPTICK, Color.DOWNTICK)); plot Maximum1 = If(close > open, close, open); plot Maximum2 = if close > open then close else open; plot Maximum3; ## Technical Analysis # FinancialLeverage ` FinancialLeverage ( Symbol symbol, int fiscalPeriod); ` Default values: ` symbol: current symbol ` ` fiscalPeriod: FiscalPeriod.YEAR ` ## Description The ` FinancialLeverage ` functions returns the ratio of a company's total assets to its common equity."
"By default, the value is returned for the currently selected symbol and based on the annual reporting data."
"To specify a different symbol for this function, modify the value of the ` symbol ` input parameter."
"To use quarterly data instead of annual, assign the ` FiscalPeriod.QUARTERLY ` constant to the ` fiscalPeriod ` input parameter."
EarningsPerShareTTM FixedChargeCoverageRatio ## Technical Analysis # MorningDojiStar ## Description Morning Doji Star is a bullish trend reversal candlestick pattern consisting of three candles.
The Morning Doji Star candlestick pattern is recognized if: The first candle is long and bearish and continues the downtrend; The second candle is Doji that gaps down from the first candle; The third candle is bullish and closes above the first candle's midpoint.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the average body height.
"If the body height of a candle exceeds this average, it is considered long."
"If the body height of a candle is less than 5% of this average, it is considered a Doji candle."
` trend setup ` | The number of preceding bars to check if the trend exists.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` Bullish ` | The Morning Doji Star candlestick pattern.
MatHold MorningStar is long and bearish and continues the downtrend; is Doji that gaps down from the first candle; ## Technical Analysis # SVEZLRBPercB ## Description The SVEZLRBPercB study is a zero-lag oscillator designed by Sylvain Vervoort.
"Its principle is akin to PercentB developed by John Bollinger, however, the formula is applied to modified data: price is subjected to smoothing using several moving averages."
"First of all, the Rainbow Moving Average is used, then the result is consequently subjected to Double and Triple Exponential Moving Average smoothing."
"This result is used as the basis for bands calculation: standard deviations are calculated for this value, thus yielding the half-distance between the upper and lower bands."
Principle of Percent B is then applied to these bands and hlc3 price: basically this study indicates the position of this price relative to the bands.
"Zero value of the indicator means that the price touches the lower band, reading of 100 indicates that it touches the upper band, and 50 means that it is right in the middle."
The primary plot is also overlayed by a slow stochastic oscillator which is derived from the eponymous indicator with modified input.
"Instead of the Close price, this oscillator uses a synthetic value obtained from the rainbow- smoothed series, hlc3 and Simple Moving Average (see Sylvain Vervoort's article for details about the math employed)."
"When both oscillators are rising, it might be considered a Buy signal; Sell signal is suggested when both are declining."
Divergence between either oscillator and price might signify upcoming trend reversal.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price with which the Rainbow Moving Average is calculated.
` std dev length ` | Defines period on which standard deviation is found.
` ema length ` | Defines period on which moving averages are calculated.
` num dev ` | The number of standard deviations defining the half-distance between the bands.
` k period ` | Defines FastK period for stochastic calculation ` slowing period ` | Defines length of moving average for stochastic calculation.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` PercentB ` | The PercentB oscillator.
` Stochastic ` | The stochastic oscillator.
` Lower ` | Level 0.
` Middle ` | Level 50.
` Upper ` | Level 100.

Not seeing what you're looking for?
## When will my deposited funds be available for trading?
Funds transferred in through electronic ACH have a 3-business day hold on the funds upon effective date which is a day after submitting the request.
"This hold is for non-marginable securities (over-the-counter stocks, options, futures, forex, etc.)."
The funds can be used right away for fully marginable securities (generally stocks that are on a stock exchange such as NYSE or NASDAQ).
"This is the same for deposited checks, but the hold time is 4 business days from when the check posts to your account."
## What is a Pattern Day Trader?
A pattern day traders (PDT) account is a margin account that has executed more than three roundtrips in a five-business day period.
"PDT accounts must maintain a day trading minimum equity of $25,000 on any day on which day trading occurs."
"The $25,000 account-value minimum is a start-of-day value, calculated using the previous trading day's closing prices on positions held overnight."
"Day trade equity consists of marginable, non-marginable positions, and cash."
Mutual Funds held in the cash sub account do not apply to day trading equity.
"Also, funds held in the Futures or Forex sub-accounts do not apply to day trading equity."
"To avoid an account restriction, pattern day- trader accounts that fall below the $25,000 minimum equity requirement should not day trade."
## Are cash accounts subject to Pattern Day Trading rules?
No.
Cash accounts are not subject to Pattern Day Trading rules and as such you would not need to use the day trade counting tools in Thinkorswim.
"## What happens if I execute more than three roundtrips in a rolling 5 business day period with an account value less than $25,000?"
"An account that is both A) Flagged as a Pattern Day Trader and B) has less than $25,000 equity will be issued a Day Trade Minimum Equity Call (EM Call)."
"The Call does not have to be met with funding, but while in the Call the account should not make any Day Trades."
If a Day Trade is made while in the Call the account will be set to Restricted - Closing Only.
"## My account is now flagged as a pattern day trading account and its value is less than $25,000 what can I do?"
"We have multiple potential solutions to help with this: We can assist with making a deposit/transfer to the account to bring its value to at least the $25,000 minimum."
Cash accounts are not subject to pattern day trading rules.
"We can assist you with converting a margin account to a cash account, but the cash account would be subject to settlement on each trade placed."

above).
We can review your account to see if a day trade flag removal is available on your account.
"## In my cash account, when can I use my funds again to trade?"
Cash account settlement procedures are governed by Federal Regulation T. Reg T states that funds from investments that you sell won't be available to put toward another purchase until the first transaction settles.
Reg T settlement times are T+2 (trading day plus two business days) for stock trades and T+1 for options.
"So, if you bought XYZ on Monday and then sold it on Tuesday the funds wouldn't be available to put toward the purchase of ABC until Wednesday."
"(Monday, the day of the original purchase, plus two business days = Wednesday.)"
"## In my cash account, when can I withdraw my funds used for trading?"
"If you want to withdraw the proceeds of a sale from your account, you would have to wait until settlement of the trade 2 business days from the sale date."
"Using the example in the above question, the proceeds from the sale of XYZ would be available Thursday (Tuesday, the date of the sale, plus two business days.)"
To avoid the settlement times to which Cash accounts are subject you could consider applying for Margin trading.
Funds are available for purchase immediately in a Margin account.
(Note: Margin accounts must adhere to Finra's Pattern Day Trading rule).
Our Margin handbook can be accessed HERE .
_Margin trading increases risk of loss and includes the possibility of a forced sale if account equity drops below required levels.
Margin is not available in all account types.
Margin trading privileges subject to TD Ameritrade review and approval.
Carefully review the Margin Handbook and Margin Disclosure Document for more details.
Please see our website or contact TD Ameritrade at 800-669-3900 for copies._ ## What is a good faith funding violation?
Good faith violations occur when clients buy and sell securities before paying for the initial purchases in full with settled funds.
Only cash or proceeds from a sale are considered settled funds.
"Heres an example of a good-faith violation: On Monday, Janet holds $10,000 worth of XYZ."
"On Tuesday, Janet sells her entire XYZ position for $10,500, which will settle Thursday."
"Wednesday morning, Janet buys $10,500 of FAHN on good faith that XYZs sale will settle."
"Wednesday afternoon, Janet sells FAHN for $11,000, making a $500 profit."
"However, FAHNs original purchase wasnt fully paid for because XYZs sale hadnt yet settled."
"If this happens three times in a 12-month period, a client will be restricted to trading with settled cash for 90 days."
## How can I see my completely settled funds before placing a trade?
Looking at cash available for withdrawal will show you the fully settled funds in your account.
Login to www.tdameritrade.com and go to my account>deposits/transfers>withdraw>transfer from your bank.
On the right hand side of the screen it will show a number for cash available for withdrawal.
If you are using the thinkorswim mobile app this information can be found under more>transfers>to/from bank account.
## What are the requirements to get approved for futures trading?
"To apply for futures trading approval, your account must have: Margin approval Advanced Features enabled Tier 2 or 3 options approval An account minimum of $1,500 is required for margin accounts."
"A minimum net liquidation value (NLV) of $25,000 to trade futures in an IRA."
"Only SEP, Roth, traditional, and rollover IRAs are eligible for futures trading."
"Additionally, IRA accounts must maintain a minimum net liquidation value (NLV) of $25,000 to trade futures."
"Only SEP, Roth, traditional, and rollover IRAs are eligible for futures trading."
"Please keep in mind that not all clients will qualify, and meeting all requirements doesn't guarantee approval."
"If you'd like more information about requirements or to ensure you have the required settings or permissions on your account, contact us at 866-839-1100."
## How do I apply for futures approval?
Visit tdameritrade.com and log in to your account.
Go to Client Services > My Profile > General.
"Under Elections & Routing, look for Futures, and click Apply."
## How can I trade in the pre/post market?
"In order for a trade to be eligible to work in the pre or post market, the order needs to be entered as a limit order."
In addition the TIF (time in force) needs to be changed from a day order to either ext or gtc_ext.
ext orders will work from 6 am to 7 pm central time for 1 trading day.
"Standard gtc_ext orders will work from 6 am to 7 pm central time for 180 trading days, or until the order fills."
"This is most commonly found in over the counter stocks, as well as options which do not trade in the extended hours."
"## My short option finished out of the money at expiration, is it guaranteed to expire worthless?"
Not necessarily.
"On the day of expiration long option holders have until 4 pm central time, 4:30 best efforts to put in contrarian instructions (such as exercising an option that officially finished out of the money based on the 3 pm central closing price, or putting in a do not exercise on an option that finished in the money)."
"Therefore, there is still risk of being assigned on short options, even if they officially finish out of the money based on the 3 pm central closing price."
That is one of the reasons why there is no commission charge for closing out single leg short options for 5 cents or less.
## How do I trade in the extended session?
"To place trades in the pre and post market, you will need to use a LIMIT order and change the TIF (time in force) to EXT (day plus extended session) or GTC_EXT (good til canceled plus extended session)."
Only securities listed on the NASDAQ & NYSE exchanges are eligible for extended session trading.
Pre-market hours are from 7am 9:28am EST.
After market is from 4:02pm 8pm EST.
"We do offer 24 hour trading on select securities, and for those orders you will need to use a Limit order and change the TIF (Time in Force) of the order to EXTO (24 hour session for one full day) or GTC_EXTO (24 hour session that is also good til canceled)."
These orders are 24 hour continuous orders that expire at 8 pm ET each day.
"You can find more information, including a list of the securities offered in this session, here ."
## What does Limit Up mean?
Limit Up is a term used in futures trading.
It refers to the maximum increase allowed in one trading day on a specific contract.
"One important thing to note, if a contract goes limit up, it does continue to trade, it just cannot go above the limit up price."
"Example: For the S&P 500, Russell 2000, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq 100 Index futures, during non US trading hours (5 PM to 8:30 am Central Time) (5 PM to 8:30 am Central Time) Limit Up is set at 7%, based off of the 3 pm central time futures fixing price."
"During that time, if the /ES, or /MES goes up 7% from the 3 pm central fixing futures price, limit up rules will be in effect."
"The contract will continue to trade, but cannot be traded higher than the limit up price, until US trading hours open at 8:30 am central time."
## What does Limit Down mean?
Limit Down is a term used in futures trading.
It refers to the maximum decline allowed in one trading day on a specific contract.
"One important thing to note, if a contract goes limit down, it does continue to trade, it just cannot go below the limit down price."
"Example: For the S&P 500, Russell 2000, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq 100 Index futures, during non US trading hours (5 PM to 8:30 am Central Time) Limit Down is set at 7%, based off of the 3 pm central time futures fixing price."
"During that time, if the /ES, or /MES goes 7% down from the 3 pm central fixing futures price, limit down rules will be in effect."
"The contract will continue to trade, but cannot be traded lower than the limit down price, until US trading hours open at 8:30 am central time."

: : ## Technical Analysis # StochRSI ## Description The Stochastic RSI technical indicator applies Stochastic Oscillator to values of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) .
The indicator thus produces two main plots FullK and FullD oscillating between oversold and overbought levels.
This combination of indicators produces signals that tend to be more precise than those given by the RSI.
The interpretation of the indicator is similar to the original RSI's: valuable signals are often produced at crossovers of the main plot with overbought and oversold levels.
"However, the default values of these levels are slightly different: in the stochastic version, these are at 80 and 20, respectively."
Actual indication of the crossovers can be enabled by adjusting the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` rsi length ` | The number of bars with which the RSI is calculated.
` over bought ` | The overbought level value.
` over sold ` | The oversold level value.
"` rsi average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in the calculation of the RSI: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
` rsi price ` | The type of price with which the RSI is calculated.
` k period ` | The period on which the highest and the lowest price values are to be found.
` d period ` | The length of the moving average to be applied to FullK.
This produces the FullD plot.
` slowing period ` | The length of the moving average to be applied to %K.
This produces the FullK plot.
"` average type ` | The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
` show breakout signals ` | Controls indication of Stochastic RSI crossovers above and below the overbought/oversold levels.
Specify for which of the main plots the crossovers are to be indicated.
"## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` FullK ` | FullK value, 'slowing period' moving average of %K."
"` FullD ` | FullD value, 'd period' moving average of FullK."
` OverBought ` | The overbought level.
` OverSold ` | The oversold level.
"` UpSignal ` | If enabled, displays an up arrow every time the specified main plot crosses above the oversold level."
"` DownSignal ` | If enabled, displays a down arrow every time the specified main plot crosses below the overbought level."

These parameters are business-specific and based on both internal and external factors: the set of parameters is almost never the same for different companies.
"Available for a number of symbols, Company Profile provides you with essential information on the corresponding company and allows you to simulate different hypothetical scenarios."
All Videos The Company Profile feature is available from the following interfaces: Trade - > All Products .
Click Company Profile in the header.

Type in a symbol to view companys essential information and details provided by Trefis.
Note: not all symbols can be viewed in Company Profile.
"You can view a watchlist of all symbols for which the Company Profile is available: to do so, choose Company Profile in the watchlist selector."
The Company Profile window is divided into two parts: What Drives the Stock and Company Overview .
"Company Overview is a Trefis report that covers subjects like Valuation Highlights , Potential Upside and Downside to Trefis Price , Business Summary , Sources of Value , and Key Trends ."
The data in this overview will help you develop hypothetical scenarios that can be simulated in the What Drives the Stock section.
The first thing you see in What Drives the Stock is an interactive diagram of business divisions of the company whose stock you are researching.
Each division is represented by default as percent of market capitalization and their block sizes are proportional to this percentage.
"To view it as estimated values, choose the corresponding option from the Show dropdown above."
The whole diagram is accompanied by a Trefis price estimate and its difference from the current market price.
A large difference between the Trefis estimate and the market price might suggest that the stock is somewhat mispriced by the market.
Click on a division to view available forecasts related to it.
"For example, clicking on the division responsible for cellphone production will provide you with forecasts of phone pricing or the number of phones sold."
"Note that some of the divisions have sub-divisions, for example, computer production may also suggest software and services or peripherals."
"In this case, the forecasts are displayed separately for each sub-division."
Clicking on a forecast will display a plot of the value being analyzed: its timespan normally includes five years before and seven years after the current date.
Each forecast can be modified: drag the handles and watch the forecast change.
"By default, smooth editing is enabled (dragging any handle will move other handles along with it)."
"To turn off the smooth editing so that the handles may be moved independently, click on the ""graph"" icon above the forecast."
Modifying the forecasts may affect the division diagram and the estimated price.
"If any of the forecasts is modified, the system will display Your estimated price which may be different from the Trefis estimate and/or current market price."
"To reset the modified forecast, click the ""revert"" icon above the forecast."

It produces values equal to +1 until a decline greater than specified percentage from the previous swing point has occurred; values equal to -1 continue until a rise greater than specified percentage from the previous swing point has occurred.
"Use positive parts of the ZigZagTrendPercent plot for confirmation of uptrend sections of ZigZagPercent study, and negative parts for confirmation of the downtrend sections."
Note that it can be especially useful for the last segment of the ZigZagPercent study.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used to calculate swing points.
` reversal amount ` | The threshold percentage of the price.
Market moves greater than this value trigger switching of the study plot from +1 to -1 and vice versa.

"ZigZagSign ZigZagTrendSign than specified percentage from the previous swing point has occurred; ## Technical Analysis # LBR_ThreeTenOscillator ## Description The Three Ten Oscillator study comprises four plots, the combination of which is used to determine Buy and Sell signals."
These signals are related to two plots of the study: the Fast Line plot and the Slow Line plot.
There are two modes of calculating the Fast Line plot.
"In normal mode, the Fast Line plot shows the difference between the two simple moving averages of price: 3 period and 10 period ones."
"In the alternate mode, this plot represents a 2 period moving average of difference between the price and a 3 period moving average of price from 3 bars ago."
"In both modes, the Slow Line plot is a slow (16 period) simple moving average of the first plot."
"When the Fast Line overtakes the Slow Line, it is interpreted as an uptrend, while the Fast Line falling below the Slow Line signifies a downtrend."
"Thus, the corresponding crossovers of the two plots are considered to indicate Buy and Sell signals."
"For additional confirmation, the mentioned plots are complemented with Zero Line and Hist plots (the latter represents Fast Line values in the histogram form)."
Positive values of the histogram confirm the Buy signal and negative values confirm the Sell signal.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | The price used to calculate the averages.
` calculation mode ` | Defines whether normal or alternate mode is used.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` FastLine ` | The Fast Line plot.
` SlowLine ` | The Slow Line plot.
` Hist ` | The Fast Line histogram.

"There are a number of ways to save different settings, i.e."
"drawings, charts, styles, etc."
"These are saved server-side, meaning they will be persistent regardless of the computer you login with."
"To save your currently viewed settings, click on Setup in the upper-right corner of the platform, then Save Workspace as, designate a name for the workspace and press OK."
"These are saved locally to your computer, so they will not be available if you log in using a different computer."
## How do I move my settings from one computer to another?
There are 2 ways this can be done.
We will outline both methods below.
"Method 1: Pull up all the settings that you would like to transfer from the first computer (detach your grids, charts, analyzed trades, etc), then click on Setup>Save Workspace As and give it a name."
This will create a file in the thinkorswim directory (c:\program files\thinkorswim) with a name called workspace.whatevername.xml.
Basically anything that displayed on the screen when the workspace is saved will be transferred.
"If you have several grids, open each of these and detach them so that they are displaying on the screen prior to saving the workspace."
Then go to the thinkorswim directory: 1\.
Exit the thinkorswim software 2\.
Right click on the thinkorswim icon 3\.
Left click on OPEN FILE LOCATION In the thinkorswim folder you will see a folder called Backup (this folder may not exist) as well as files named workspace..xml.
Move all of these to the new machine.
You will then be able to pull up these settings when logging in with the saved workspace you transferred.
Once the detached charts load you can then save all the necessary settings to your other computer accordingly.
For Watchlists: Export the watchlist by clicking on the printer icon on the top of the watchlist and select Export.
Then save this file in CSV format to your computer.
You should be able to import this same watchlist to the platform on the new computer once you have transferred this file as well.
"Once logged into the platform, click the small gear button on the top of the watchlist in your gadgets or in MarketWatch>Quote and select Create New Watch List."
"Next, click Import and select the file (you may have to edit this file prior to import and remove anything that is not a symbol)."
Method 2: (this option is not currently available for account holders in Canada or Asia) You can also transfer your settings by using the share feature.
"First, click the setup button at the top right of the main thinkorswim window."
"In the menu, select 'Save workspace as...' Once you have given your workspace a name and successfully saved it, click the Setup button again."
Now select 'Share workspace'.
"There are two of these options, the share option ending in the three '...' will share the current workspace, while the share workspace option with the small arrow icon, will allow you to select from a list of workspaces, in the event that you have more than one."
Once you select 'Share workspace' a new window will appear.
"At the lower right, click the button that says 'Share."
"(If this is the first time you are using the feature, you will be asked to create a nickname to share under."
Type in a name and submit.)
"After you click the button, a web link will appear in its place."
The link will be automatically copied to your clipboard.
"Now, you can paste the link into the sharing method of your choice."
You can right click and paste the link into an email to send to yourself or another user.
You can paste it to any text document and back it up on an external hard-drive.
"You can even write the link down on a piece of paper, as long as you write it exactly as it appear on screen (including upper case letters and numbers)."
"Once you are at the machine where you want to transfer your settings to, login to the thinkorswim software and click the 'Setup' button at the top right."
"This time, select 'Open shared item'."
In the new window use Ctrl+V to paste the link (right click paste does not work in this field) or manually type in the link.
"Then click 'Preview', and finally 'Open'."
You will get an option to save and rename the file you transferred.
"Once you have done this, go into the corresponding save section to load your settings."
"If you shared a workspace, go to the 'Setup' button and at the bottom of the menu you will see the workspace save."
Click it to load it onto the software.
"The share feature is available for use for more than just the workspace, you can use it to share single charts, grids, styles, study sets, watchlists, and custom scripts as well."
Sharing does not include any account sensitive information.
## General troubleshooting instructions for getting stuck on Installing Updates.
"Every time the thinkorswim software is opened, you will see a window that reads Installing Updates."
"During this time, the platform will install any available updates."
"Please note, the platform will always check for updates , if none are available, it will then take you to the login screen."
"If you get stuck on this screen, try left clicking directly on the words Installing Updates, this will open up a hidden window where you can check to see if things are progressing, or if there is an error message."
"If you look towards the right of the window, you will also see a scroll bar, this doubles as a progress bar."
"The smaller the bar gets, the closer it is to completing."
"If you see an error message or if the process stops progressing, please take the following steps."
"If you are connected wirelessly, you can start troubleshooting by shutting the computer down and power cycling your router."
"This involves unplugging the router from the power source for 30 seconds, then reconnect the router, and finally, reboot the computer."
"If you are hard wired, check that your Ethernet cable is securely connected on both ends."
If this does not resolve the issue you may want to reach out to your internet service provider for further support.
"If you find that your connection is not the root cause of the problem, something else you can try is to delete the ""usergui"" folder."
"_Please note; if there are indeed connection issues, deleting this folder will slow the ""Installing Updates"" screen even further."
_ _It is imperative that any connection issues are ruled out before trying this option._ You will find the steps below.

"Turning off a computer severs attackers' connections, which they may have created with spyware or a botnet."
## How does a firewall protect my computer?
An Internet connection puts your PC and any information on it at risk for a variety of threats.
"A personal firewall can help protect you, especially if you use an ""always on"" broadband Internet connection (cable or DSL)."
A firewall controls traffic between a computer and a network to ensure that only legitimate traffic takes place.
"You can use a firewall to disguise and hide the presence of computers behind it, or simply to protect one individual machine, making it more difficult for a hacker to find and attack any computer it protects."
Install a software firewall on all your computers and attach a hardware firewall as well.
"The latest Windows operating system with service pack updates (patches) includes a built-in, free Windows firewall with inbound and outbound traffic control."
Conduct an Internet search to help identify popular firewall products.
## How do I clear my browser cache and personal browsing history?
"An Internet browser retains a history of how you used the Internet, including personal information."
Clearing the cache periodically can improve browser performance and security.
See the links below for instructions.
Internet Explorer | Chrome | Firefox | Safari ## How can I identify spyware on my computer?
Spyware enables intruders to see what you're doing on your computer and potentially gather personal information.
It can also adversely affect your computer's performance.
Your computer may contain spyware if: You see numerous pop-up advertisements Your settings changed and you cannot change them back Your Web browser contains additional components that you don't remember downloading Your computer seems sluggish There are several commercial and non-commercial products that will locate and remove spyware.
"In addition, taking these steps may help protect your computer from spyware: Use a firewall."
Update your software to make sure you have all of the latest security updates.
Adjust your Web browsers security settings to control how much information you want to accept from a website.
Only download programs from websites you trust.
## What should I know about operating system patches?
Operating system patches can help protect your computer from threats.

## Technical Analysis # crosses ## Syntax ` <value1> crosses above <value2> ` ` <value1> crosses below <value2> ` ` <value1> crosses <value2> ` ## Description This reserved word is used as a human-readable version of the ` Crosses ` function.
It tests if ` value1 ` gets higher or lower than ` value2 ` .
"## Example plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot ArrowUp = close crosses above Avg; plot ArrowDown = close crosses below Avg; plot Cross = close crosses Avg; ArrowUp.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_UP); ArrowDown.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_DOWN); Cross.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); This code plots up arrows indicating the bars at which the close price gets above its 10 period average, and down arrows where the close price gets below its 10 period average."
"The same result can be achieved by using the ` Crosses ` function: plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot ArrowUp = Crosses(close, Avg, CrossingDirection.ABOVE); plot ArrowDown = Crosses(close, Avg, CrossingDirection.BELOW); plot Cross = Crosses(close, Avg, CrossingDirection.ANY); ArrowUp.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_UP); ArrowDown.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_ARROW_DOWN); Cross.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); ## Example plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot Cross = close crosses Avg; Cross.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); This code plots arrows indicating the bars at which the Close price gets higher or lower than its 10 period average."
"The equivalent code is: plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot Cross = close crosses above Avg or close crosses below Avg; Cross.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.BOOLEAN_POINTS); case declare plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot ArrowUp = close crosses above Avg; plot ArrowDown = close crosses below Avg; plot Cross = close crosses Avg; plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot ArrowUp = Crosses(close, Avg, CrossingDirection.ABOVE); plot ArrowDown = Crosses(close, Avg, CrossingDirection.BELOW); plot Cross = Crosses(close, Avg, CrossingDirection.ANY); plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot Cross = close crosses Avg; plot Avg = Average(close, 10); plot Cross = close crosses above Avg or close crosses below Avg; ## Technical Analysis # DeviationScaledOscillator ## Description Deviation Scaled Oscillator is an RSI-based technical indicator that attempts to eliminate probability bias, which is common in other oscillators."
"Probability bias occurs when certain trends prevail in the analyzed data, thus the probability ditribution graph can be distorted."
"To address this issue, Fisher transform is utilized in Deviation Scaled Oscillator."
"In addition, several signal processing techniques are applied to eliminate noise in data."
The calculation of Deviation Scaled Oscillator is as follows: 1.
A two-bar close price difference is found and run through the SuperSmootherFilter with half the period specified for the Deviation Scaled Oscillator.
2.
Root mean square of the value derived at Step 1 is calculated.
3.
The ratio of the first value to the second value is found.
4.
Values derived at Step 3 that fall into -2.0 to +2.0 range are run through the Fisher transform.
Values out of this range are plotted unchanged.
Values of the oscillator around the +2.0 level might signify overbought conditions while those around -2.0 might signify oversold conditions.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` length ` | The period on which the Deviation Scaled Oscillator is calculated.
` over bought ` | The overbought level.
` over sold ` | The oversold level.
"` show breakout signals ` | Set this parameter to ""no"" to hide breakout signals."
The signals are given when the main plot crosses above the oversold level or below the overbought level.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` DSO ` | The Deviation Scaled Oscillator plot.
` OverBought ` | The overbought level.
` ZeroLine ` | The zero level.
` OverSold ` | The oversold level.
` UpSignal ` | A signal given when Deviation Scaled Oscillator crosses above the oversold level.
` DownSignal ` | A signal given when Deviation Scaled Oscillator crosses below the overbought level.

Kaufman in an attempt to reveal seasonal patterns in stock prices.
The study is designed to be used on monthly charts only.
"For each month over the past several years, this study calculates the deviation of the monthly price from the yearly average price."
"In addition, the frequency of positive returns is calculated for each month over the same time interval."
The result is shown on a lower subgraph as a colored histogram.
The longest histogram bars represent the months with the highest positive-return frequency.
"Vice versa, the shortest bars represent the months with the lowest positive-return frequency."
"Two additional customizable reference levels are shown: by default, these are set at 75% for high frequency and 25% for low frequency."
Combining the seasonal returns with the consistency of such returns over time may help identify the probability of positive return for each individual month.
This approach is used in the Seasonal Trading strategy.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` years ` | The length of the period on which Monthly Seasonality is to be calculated.
` high frequency ` | The minimum high-frequency level.
` low frequency ` | The maximum low-frequency level.
## Plots Plot | Description ---|--- ` PositiveReturnsFrequency ` | The monthly histogram of positive returns.

"Both versions are based on the observation that in an uptrending market, prices tend to close near the upper end of the price range."
"In downtrends, close prices are often seen approach the lower end."
"Akin to the Stochastic Fast, this slower version calculates the %K value: the ratio of the difference between the current close and the lowest low on a period to the difference between the highest and the lowest prices on the same period."
The first main plot is produced by smoothing this value with a 3-period moving average; it is thus called SlowK (compare to FastK in the StochasticFast).
"The other plot, SlowD is a moving average of SlowK over a chosen period."
Both lines oscillate in the range from 0 to 100.
"Although the Stochastic Slow tends to produce fewer signals than the fast oscillator, these signals are often found to be more precise."
"The analysis technique is, however, the same: the crossovers of main plots with overbought/oversold levels are normally looked for."
Actual indication of the crossovers can be enabled by adjusting the ` show breakout signals ` parameter value.
"See also: StochasticSlow , StochasticFull ."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` over bought ` | The overbought level value.
` over sold ` | The oversold level value.

Regression Channel ## Technical Analysis # DoubleSmoothedStochastic ## Description The Double Smoothed Stochastic study is a momentum-based oscillator that includes double EMA smoothing in the calculation of the Stochastic indicator.
"Akin to the latter, the Double Smoothed Stochastic is calculated as a percentage ratio, however the components of that ratio are slightly different: The nominator is equal to the difference of the current close and the lookback period's low consequently smoothed by two EMAs; The denominator is equal to the lookback period's high-low range consequently smoothed by the same EMAs."
"The Double Smoothed Stochastic oscillator can be used as an overbought- oversold indicator: indicator values higher than 70 may indicate overbought conditions, while those below 30 tend to indicate oversold conditions."
Looking for divergences of the indicator from the price plot may also prove useful.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` r length ` | The period of the second EMA.
` s length ` | The period of the first EMA.
` length ` | The lookback period on which the high and the low prices are to be found.

"This oscillator incorporates two filters, the Super Smoother Filter and the Roofing Filter , both developed by John F. Ehlers."
Data derived from these two filters is processed by automatic gain control algorithm and then subjected to the quotient transform.
"The quotient transform, controlled by the K coefficient, collapses small oscillator values while keeping higher values high."
"The strategy uses the oscillator twice, with different values of K coefficient."
This ensures more precise trend detection.
"Suggested values for the coefficient are 0.8 and 0.4, customizable via input parameters."
The strategy adds a simulated Buy order when the first oscillator crosses above zero (which corresponds to uptrend detection) and a Sell to close order when the second oscillator crosses below zero (which signifies that the uptrend is over).
## Input Parameters ` price ` | Defines the price to which the oscillator is applied.
---|--- ` cutoff length ` | Defines the minimum cycle length in bars.
Cycles with lesser lengths will be considered noise and eliminated.
` roof cutoff length ` | Defines the maximum cycle length in bars.
Cycles with greater lengths will be considered spectral dilation and eliminated.
` k1 ` | The K coefficient used in quotient transform for the first oscillator.
` k2 ` | The K coefficient used in quotient transform for the second oscillator.

GetYYYYMMDD RegularTradingStart ## Technical Analysis # MovAvgStrat ## Description The Moving Average Strategy adds Buy and Sell orders upon crossovers of price with its moving average.
"By default, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) is used in calculations, nevertheless, you are free to use other types of moving averages: exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull ."
Two modes of trading are used in this strategy: trend following and reversal.
"In the trend following mode, the strategy adds a simulated Buy order when the price crosses above its average, and a simulated Sell order when it crosses below."
"For the reversal mode, conditions are vice versa: a Buy order is added when the price crosses below the average and a Sell order is added when it crosses above."
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price ` | Defines price used in calculation of the average.

This strategy ... ## Technical Analysis # MonkeyBars ## Description The Monkey Bars study represents trading activity over a time period at specified price levels.
"The Monkey Bars study is made up of Time-Price opportunities (TPOs), each one is represented by a digit."
"When the price falls into a specified interval within the first aggregation period, the interval is assigned digit ""1""."
"Once the first aggregation period is over, its price range is defined with a column split into equal intervals, each one marked with digit ""1""; the study proceeds to find TPOs for the second aggregation period, assigning digit ""2"" to the TPOs."
This procedure is repeated for each aggregation period within the time period; TPOs are assigned consequent numbers so that the study has a set of columns filled with numbers as a primary result.
Each column is then collapsed to the leftmost one.
"Note that if the number of aggregation periods exceeds 10, each following decade is represented by a sequence of digits starting with 1 and highlighted with a different color."
The longest row of Monkey Bars defines the price level which was the most frequent during the specified time period; this level is called Monkey Bar (MB).
"If there are several equally long rows that fit this description, the system chooses the closest to the price mid-range."
"Should the rows be equidistant from the mid-range, the system recognizes the lower one as the Monkey Bar."
"By default, the price range surrounding the Monkey Bar level where 70% of the trading activity took place for the specified time period is called The Playground (note that the percentage is customizable within the ""the playground percent"" input parameter)."
You can also complement sections of Monkey Bars with Volume Profile histograms and Initial Balance brackets.
See the Input Parameters section to learn how to customize display properties of these features.
## Input Parameters Parameter | Description ---|--- ` price per row height mode ` | Defines the height setting mode for each row of the histogram.
"""AUTOMATIC"" splits the trading range of the time period into 50 equal intervals."

"Unlike the regular Momentum ... equal intervals, each one marked with digit ""1""; ## How to thinkorswim # Volume Dots Volume dots, or spheres, are a representation of the transactions that have taken place on the best bid and ask."
They are shown across the chart.
"The color of each dot corresponds to the aggressor side: red is for sell side, and green is for buy side."
"When a volume dot resembles a pie chart, it means that the volume accumulated for this dot contains both buy and sell aggressor side trades."
Zoom in onto this dot to see individual trades for both sides.
"This will also work for a single-color dot: in this case, zooming in onto it will display individual trades of the same side."
The size of each dot is proportionate to the cumulative volume of all trades this dot consists of.
You can proportionally change the size of each volume dot by using the Volume dots slider above the chart.
To customize volume dots: 1\.
Right-click on a volume bar and choose Volume Settings .
This will open the Studies configuration menu with the Volume dots tab active.
2\.
"In the Volume display options area, you can specify the following: Coloring mode ."
Choose 2D Dots to display the relative size of buy and sell aggressor trades as a pie chart of two solid colors.
Choose 3D Bubbles to use a gradient scale for the relative size of buy and sell aggressor sides.
Calculation mode .
Choose Total volume to display the total volume traded during the aggregation period.
Choose Volume delta to display the difference between buy and sell order sizes.
3\.
Select the desirable dot using the Size slider.
You can also do this by using the slider above the chart as long as Display slider on the toolbar is activated.
4\.
Use the Transparency slider to set the desirable transparency for your volume dots.
5\.
"In the Clustering dropdown, select the desirable mode of volume dot clustering: Smart ."
"Using a proprietary Bookmap algorithm, the system aggregates several adjacent dots into a single one."
This algorithm takes into account both VWAP and time of execution.
Drag the slider on the right to make this clustering more or less pronounced.
Time .
The dots are shown in equal intervals with their size being proportionate to the aggregated transaction volume.
You can select the desirable aggregation period from the dropdown to the right.
Volume .
The system shows a new volume dot after a specified volume accumulates.
You can specify the desirable cumulative volume using the combo-box on the right.
Note : A dot may cumulate more contracts than the specified value.
This happens when the size of the last trade exceeds the limit value.
"For example, if the specified volume limit is 100 and the volume dot consists of two single sequential trades of 50 and 100 in size, the volume dot will show 150 contracts traded, not 100."
Aggregation by price .
"All trades are accumulated in a single volume dot as long as they happen at the same price level, regardless of the aggressor side."
5\.
You can have both volume dots and volume bars use the same clustering mode.
"To do so, either click Inherit from bars so that dots inherit the mode from the bars or click Apply to bars to make the bars use the same mode as the dots do."

Note that Social Sentiment is not available for some symbols.
"You can view a watchlist of all symbols for which it is available: to do so, choose Social Sentiment in the watchlist selector."
"In Social Sentiment, the mentions are displayed as a stacked area which uses the same time interval and aggregation period as the chart itself (limited to daily and hourly aggregations in a standard mode)."
"By default, there are three parts in this area: the bottom part represents the number of negative mentions of all divisions affiliated with the company, the middle part visualizes the positive mentions count, and the top part is reserved for the neutral ones."
All of these values and the total number of mentions are displayed also in the status string.
The area is accompanied with the Sentiment plot which visualizes the rate of approval of the company: it is calculated as the ratio of positive mentions count to the sum of positive and negative counts (neutral mentions are excluded from the calculation).
"The stacked area is customizable: you can turn off and on some of its parts, change their colors, and also edit the list of divisions for which it will be plotted."
"To do so, right-click anywhere on the subgraph and choose Customize... or just double-click anywhere on the stacked area."
"In the dialog window, de-select components and/or company divisions that are of little importance to you at the moment; click OK ."
The stacked area will be updated according to your preferences.

AccumulationDistributionStrat ADXTrend plot is higher than the average; ## Technical Analysis # ERTrend ## Description The ERTrend strategy is based on the trend-following indicator Efficiency Ratio (ER) .
"Values of this indicator are interpreted by the strategy as follows: ER values being greater than both a lower threshold ( ` crit level ` in the input parameters) and its own lowest value times a multiplier are read as indication of trend development; ER values being greater than a higher threshold level ( ` trend level ` in the input parameters ) but lower than the maximum level are interpreted as strong trending conditions; If either of these conditions is true and close price rises above its own moving average, a simulated buy-to-open order is added."
"In the same conditions, a simulated sell-to-open order is added should the close price fall below the average."
"Simulated exit orders are added based on crossovers of the close price plot with its moving average: when the close price crosses below the average, a simulated sell-to-close order is added; when it crosses above - the simulation of buy-to-close takes place."
## Input Parameters ` length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the Efficiency Ratio (ER).
---|--- ` er average length ` | The number of bars used to calculate the ER average.
` lag ` | Defines the period upon which the lowest ER value is to be found (used in checking for trend development).
` average length ` | Defines the period for the calculation of the close price moving average.
` trend level ` | Defines the minimum ER level at which strong trending conditions are recognized.
` max level ` | Defines the maximum ER level at which strong trending conditions are recognized.
` crit level ` | Defines the minimum ER level at which trend development is recognized.

The author emphasizes that this strategy is shown for educational purposes only.
"In order to simulate Buy and Sell orders, the strategy calculates three averages: one of hlc3 (arithmetic mean of high, low, and close), one of Heikin Ashi ohlc4 (arithmetic mean of Heikin Ashi open, high, low, and close), and one of the close price."
The simulated orders are added upon the following conditions: Buy Auto .
Average hlc3 price rises above the average Heikin Ashi price at a bullish bar.
Sell Auto .
Average hlc3 price falls below the average Heikin Ashi price at a bearish bar.
Buy To Close .
There is a short position and the close is greater than both its average value and the open.
Sell To Close .
There is a long position and the close is less than both its average value and the open.
## Input Parameters ` length ` | The number of bars used in the calculation of averages of hlc3 and Heikin Ashi prices.
---|--- ` exit length ` | The number of bars used in the calculation of the close price average.
## Plots ` AveragePrice ` | The average of hlc3.
---|--- ` AverageHaPrice ` | The average of Heikin Ashi ohlc4.
` AverageExit ` | The average of the close price.
` Market ` | A histogram that illustrates how the simulated orders are added.

"Meaning, if a stock on a given day has already dropped by more than 10% since the previous day's close it must trade higher before it can be shorted again."
This rule does not apply to exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
## Uptrend Successive upward price movements in a security over time.
## Technical Analysis # GoldenTriangleLE ## Description The Golden Triangle (Long Entry) strategy is a moving average based technical indicator developed by Charlotte Hudging in attempt to identify promising entries on stock charts.
"This strategy is an improvement on a popular ""buy on a dip"" practice that suggests making entries after a significant decline in hope that the price would eventually rise."
The main principle of the strategy is to look for accelerating stocks that suddenly fall and then return to the initial uptrend.
"This sudden fall, anticipated to be a part of a bottom formation, defines the suggested entry point."
"While seeing bottoms appear on charts is quite common, their uptrend sections might be not as satisfying as one can expect."
The Golden Triangle strategy is said to help identify stocks that are likely to regain acceleration.
The name of this strategy refers to a geometrical figure that forms on chart when pullback and recovery fragments of the price action satisfy certain criteria.
The strategy uses the following criteria for the Golden Triangle identification: Initial uptrend.
"Golden Triangles form after an uptrend, so the strategy initially looks for a stock's price that rises faster than its moving average."
"By default, the 50 period simple moving average (SMA) is used."
Pivot point.
This point defines where the price switches to a short-term downtrend.
Price drop.
"After the pivot, price needs to drop below its SMA and maintain this level throughout the price drop."
This defines the initial setup of the Golden Triangle.
"When the mentioned criteria are met, the strategy looks for price and volume confirmation to add a simulated Buy order."
"The price confirms when after the previously described downfall, it finally closes above its confirmation SMA."
The volume confirms when it is at highest within last several days and greater than its long-term SMA.
The volume needs to confirm on the same day the price confirmation happens or on a later day when the close price is greater than its previous value.
## Input Parameters ` average length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of the long-term SMA.
This SMA is calculated for both price and volume.
---|--- ` confirmation length ` | The number of bars used in calculation of the short-term confirmation SMA of price.
` volume length ` | Defines the confirmation period upon which the highest volume is found.
## Plots ` priceAvg ` | The long-term SMA of the close price.
